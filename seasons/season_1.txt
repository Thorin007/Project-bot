told someone but who would he tell my husband if he told the king both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now whatever jon arryn knew or didn't know it died with him and robert will choose a new hand of the king someone to do his job while he off fucking boars and hunting whores get back on your horse or is it the other way around and life will go on you should be the hand of the

a mind to leave them all behind and keep going i've half a mind to go with you what do you say just you and me on the kingsroad swords at our sides well mormont as brutish as this life is a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight you should have asked me 20 years ago there were wars to fight woman to marry we never had the chance to be young i recall a few chances there was that one oh what was her name that common girl of yours becca with the great big tits you could bury your face in bessie she was one of yours bessie thank the gods for bessie i suppose it is preferable to beheading and her tits yours was er aleena no you told me once er meryl your bastard mother wylla that it she must have been a rare wench to make lord eddard stark forget his honour you never told me what she looked like nor will i we were at war what did ned stark want you for none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again you're too hard on yourself you always have been i swear if i weren't your king you'd have hit me already the worst thing about your coronation i'll never get to hit you again trust me that not the worst thing there was a rider in the night daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord what of it do we send her a wedding gift a knife perhaps a good sharp one buying from a slaver and a bold man to wield it she little more than a child soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding tell me we're not speaking of this oh it unspeakable to you what her father did to your family that was unspeakable what rhaegar targaryen did to your sister the woman i loved i'll kill every targaryen i get my hands on but you can't get your hands on this one can you this khal drogo selling to one it said he has 100 000 man in his horde even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm as long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea they have no ships robert there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper if the targaryen boy crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the scum will join him he will not cross and if by chance he does we'll throw him back into the sea there a war coming ned i don't know when i don't know who we'll be fighting some poachers i caught on my land but it coming sit you'll be fed untie them ah rapers they were given a choice no doubt castration or the wall most choose the knife not impressed by your new brothers lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one under my reign you won't be punished for such nonsense why do you read so much look at me and tell me what you see is this a trick what you see is a dwarf if i'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for 20 years until your brother killed that king yes until my brother killed him you can rest assured of that life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honour of my house wouldn't you agree but how well my brother has his sword and i have my mind and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone that why i read so much jon snow and you betterlooking bitches than you're used to uncle what your story bastard ask me nicely and maybe i'll tell you dwarf a bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the night watch alongside his valiant brothersinarms the night watch protects the realm from ah yes yes against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about you're a smart boy you don't believe that nonsense isn't there anything else my mother been looking for you everything better with some wine in the belly it time we reviewed the accounts my lady you'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us talk to poole about it poole went south with lord stark my lady we need a new steward and there are several other appointmants that require our immediate attention i don't care about appointmants i'll make the appointmants we'll talk about it first thing in the morning we ride for king landing today very good my lord my lady when was the last time you left this room i have to take care of him he not going to die mother maester luwin says the most dangerous time has passed what if he wrong bran needs me rickon needs you he six he doesn't know what happening he follows me around all day before you go you will call on lord and lady stark clutching my leg crying close the windows i can't stand it please make them stop fire you stay here i'll come back you're not supposed to be here no one is supposed to be here it a mercy he dead already no have you ever seen a dragon dragon gone khaleesi and offer your sympathies everywhere even in the east no dragon brave man kill them it is known it is known a trader from qarth told me that dragons come from the moon the moon he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi that once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun fire what good will my sympathies do them moon is no egg moon is goddess wife of sun it is known it is known leave me with her why did the trader from qarth tell you these stories man like to talk when they're happy before your brother bought me for you it was my job to make man happy how old were you i was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house nine none but it is expected of you i did not touch a man for three years khaleesi first you must learn can you teach me how to make the khal happy yes will it take three years no welcome what i am about to tell you must remain between us i don't think bran fell from that tower i think he was thrown your absence has already been noted the boy was always surefooted before someone tried to kill him twice why why murder an innocent child unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see saw what my lady i don't know but i would stake my life the lannisters are involved we already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown did you notice the dagger the killer used it too fine a weapon for such a man the blade is valyrian steel the handle dragonbone the boy means nothing to me someone gave it to him they come into our home and try to murder my brother if it war they want if it comes to that you know i'll stand behind you what is there going to be a battle in the godswood hmm too easily words of war become acts of war we don't know the truth yet lord stark must be told of this i don't trust a raven to carry these words and i can't stand the wailing of woman i'll ride to king landing no there must always be a stark in winterfell i will go myself mother you can't i must i'll send hal with a squad of guardsman to escort you too large a party attracts unwanted attention i don't want the lannisters to know i'm coming let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone what about bran one word and i'll hit you again i have prayed to the seven for more than a month bran life is in their hands now no khaleesi you must look in his eyes always love comes in at the eyes it is said that irogenia of lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes finish a man oh kings travelled across the world for a night with irogenia the dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses i'm telling mother magisters sold their palaces khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours they say a thousand man proposed to her and she refused them all well she sounds like an interesting woman i i don't think that drogo will like it with me on top you will make him like it khaleesi man want what they've never had and the dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch go tell her are you a slave khaleesi then don't make love like a slave very good khaleesi out there he is the mighty khal but in this tent he belongs to you i i don't think that this is the dothraki way if he wanted the dothraki way why did he marry you no but first you will get to lord and lady stark no tonight i would look upon your face pardon me ser do i frighten you so much girl or is it him there making you shake he frightens me too look at that face i'm sorry if i offended you ser why won't he speak to me he hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years and you will fall on your knees in front of them since the mad king had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers he speaks damn well with his sword though ser ilyn payne the king justice the royal executioner what is it sweet lady does the hound frighten you away with you dog you're scaring my lady i don't like to see you

piss off the edge of the world the children don't need to hear your filth come even if the boy lives he'll be a cripple a grotesque give me a good clean death any day speaking for the grotesques i'd have to disagree death is so final whereas life with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night ah life is full of possibilities i hope the boy does wake i'd be very interested to hear what he has to say my dear brother there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on my dear brother you wound me you know how much i love my family please oh i would have dressed your grace this is your home i'm your guest handsome one isn't he it murders all other grass i lost my first boy a little blackhaired beauty he was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him forgive me it the last thing you need to hear right now i never knew it was years ago robert was crazed beat his hands bloody on the wall all the things man do to show you how much they care the boy looked just like him 0 game of thrones s01e03 lord snow srt welcome lord stark sturdy old thing that not true you killed the beast you only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father i didn't i when aerys targaryen sat on the iron throne your father was a rebel and a traitor someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it do i have to marry her yes she very beautiful and young if you don't like her you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses how many kings' arses have polished it i wonder and if you'd rather fuck painted whores you'll fuck painted whores and if you'd rather lie with noble virgins so be it you are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be do something nice for the stark girl i don't want to no but you will the occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road we allow the northerners too much power they consider themselves our equals how would you handle them i'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10 000 man to the royal army um what the line a royal army why should every lord command his own man it primitive no better than the hill tribes we should have a standing army of man loyal to the crown trained by experienced soldiers instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives and if the northerners rebel i'd crush them seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the north uncle kevan maybe the king shits and the hand wipes and these 10 000 northern troops would they fight for you or their lord for me i'm their king mmhm but you've just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brothers i'm not asking the north cannot be held not by an outsider it too big and too wild and when the winter comes the seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army a good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies very handsome armour so you agree the starks are enemies everyone who isn't us is an enemy enough of that young lady eat your food i'm practicing practicing for what the prince arya stop he a liar and a coward and he killed my friend the hound killed your friend the hound does whatever the prince tells him to do you're an idiot you're a liar and if you told the truth not a scratch on it i know mycah would be alive enough what happening here arya would rather act like a beast than a lady go to your room we'll speak later that for you love the same dollmaker makes all of princess myrcella toys don't you like it i haven't played with dolls since i was eight may i be excused you've barely eaten a thing people have been swinging at me for years but they always seem to miss it all right go on war was easier than daughters go away arya open the door may i come in whose sword is that mine give it to me i know this maker mark this is mikken work where did you get this this is no toy you've chosen your opponents wisely then little ladies shouldn't play with swords i wasn't playing and i don't want to be a lady come here now what do you want with this it called needle oh a blade with a name and who were you hoping to skewer with needle your sister do you know the first thing about sword fighting stick 'em with the pointy end i have a knack for it that the essence of it i was trying to learn i asked mycah to practice with me i asked him it was my fault no sweet girl no no you didn't kill the butcher boy i hate them i hate all of them the hound the queen and the king and joffrey and sansa sansa was dragged before the king and queen and asked to call the prince a liar it must be strange for you coming into this room so was i he is a liar shh darling listen to me sansa will be married to joffrey someday she cannot betray him she must take his side even when he wrong but how you can let her marry someone like that well look at me you're a stark of winterfell you know our words winter is coming grand maester pycelle has called a meeting of the small council i was standing right here when it happened you were born in the long summer you've never known anything else but now winter is truly coming and in the winter we must protect ourselves look after one another sansa is your sister i don't hate her not really i don't want to frighten you but i won't lie to you either we've come to a dangerous place we cannot fight a war amongst ourselves he was very brave your brother all right go on it yours i can keep it try not to stab your sister with it if you're going to own a sword you'd better know how to use it don't listen to it crows are all liars i know a story about a crow i hate your stories i know a story about a boy who hated stories i could tell you about ser duncan the tall those were always your favourites your father too those weren't my favourites my favourites were the scary ones oh my sweet summer child what do you know about fear fear is for the winter when the snows fall a hundred feet deep fear is for the long night when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness that is the time for fear my little lord when the white walkers move through the woods thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation they didn't deserve to die like that kings froze to death in their castles same as the shepherds in their huts and woman smothered their babies rather than see them starve and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks so is this the sort of story that you like in that darkness the white walkers came for the first time they swept through cities and kingdoms riding their dead horses hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds what are you telling him now nobody deserves to die like that only what the little lord wants to hear get your supper i want some time with him one time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant named macomber maybe we do how do you feel you still don't remember anything bran i've seen you climb a thousand times in the wind in the rain but you just stood there and watched a thousand times you never fall i did though it true isn't it what maester luwin says about my legs i'd rather be dead don't ever say that i'd rather be dead fewer eyes back here my lady but still too many it nine years since i've set foot in the capital and no one knew who i was the last time i came either 500 man just stood there and watched my lady welcome to king landing lady stark would you mind following us i would we've done nothing wrong we've been instructed to escort you into the city instructed i don't know who providing your instructions but follow me lady stark cat go on go upstairs you little worm all the great knights of the seven kingdoms you take me for some backalley sally you can drag into a pssst i meant no disrespect to you of all people how dare you bring me here have you lost your mind no one will come looking for you here isn't that what you wanted i'm truly sorry about the locale how did you know i was coming to king landing a dear friend told me lady stark lord varys to see you again after so many years is a blessing you think anyone said a word lifted a finger your poor hands how did you know i was coming knowledge is my trade my lady did you bring the dagger with you by any chance my little birds are everywhere even in the north they whisper to me the strangest stories valyrian steel do you know whose dagger this is i must admit i do not no lord stark well well this is an historic day something you don't know that i do there only one dagger like this in all of the seven kingdoms it mine yours at least it was until the tournamant on prince joffrey last nameday i bet on ser jaime in the jousting as any sane man would when the knight of the flowers unseated him i lost this dagger to whom tyrion lannister the honour of your presence is requested 500 man and this room was silent as a crypt the imp grenn show him what you farm boys are made of if that were a real sword you'd be dead lord snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you pyp do you think ned stark bastard bleeds like the rest of us next next well lord snow it appears you're the least useless person here go clean yourselves up except for the screams of course there only so much i can stomach in a day a charming man i don't need him to be charming i need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into man of the night watch and how that going commander mormont slowly a raven came for ned stark son good news or bad both and the mad king laughing lord stark i meant to give you this earlier so forgetful these days a raven from winterfell this morning good news perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife my wife is in winterfell is she yes i'm looking at you i thought that she'd be safest in here one of several such establishmants i own and later you're a funny man huh a very funny man ned ah the starks quick tempers slow minds you broke my nose bastard it an improvemant if we threw you over the wall i wonder how long it would take you to hit i wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did what are you looking at halfman when i watched the mad king die i'm looking at you yes you've got an interesting face hmm very distinctive faces all of you and what do you care about our faces it just i think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in king landing perhaps i'll write to my sister the queen about it we'll talk later lord snow everybody knew what this place was and no one told me i remembered him laughing as your father burned no one but you my father knew and he left me to rot at the wall all the same grenn father left him too outside a farmhouse when he was three pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese his little sister hadn't eaten in three days he was given a choice his right hand or the wall i've been asking the lord commander about them fascinating stories they hate me because i'm better than they are it a lucky thing none of them were trained by a masteratarms like your ser rodrik it felt like justice i don't imagine any of them had ever held a real sword before they came here oh your brother bran he woken up the mere suggestion that the queen brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason we have proof we have the blade which lord tyrion will say was stolen from him the only man who could say otherwise has no throat is that what you tell yourself at night thanks to your boy wolf petyr has promised to help us find the truth he like a little brother to me ned he would never betray my trust i'll try to keep you alive for her sake a fool task admittedly but i've never been able to refuse your wife anything i won't forget this you're a true friend don't tell anyone i have a reputation to maintain how could you be so stupid calm down you're a servant of justice he a child ten years old what were you thinking i was thinking of us you're a bit late to start complaining about it now what has the boy told them nothing he remembers nothing then what are you raving about what if it comes back to him if he tells his father what he saw we'll say he was lying we'll say he was dreaming we'll say whatever we like i think we can outfox a tenyearold and my husband i'll go to war with him if i have to they can write a ballad about us that you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in aerys targaryen back "the war for cersei cunt " let me go never let me go the boy won't talk and if he does i'll kill him him ned stark the king the whole bloody lot of them until you and i are the only people left in this world i wish i could see the girls it too dangerous just for a momant until we know who our enemies are i know they did it ned the lannisters get the girls settled in i'll be back in time for supper tell me if i'd stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back in my bones i know it littlefinger right i can't do anything without proof and if you find the proof then i bring it to robert and hope he still the man i once knew you watch yourself on the road huh that temper of yours is a dangerous thing my temper gods be good you nearly killed poor littlefinger yesterday would you admire me more he still loves you does he off with you yes it been a long time but i still remember every face you remember your first of course your grace who was it a tyroshi never learned the name hmm you served him well when serving was safe how did you do it lance through the heart quick one lucky for you mine was some tarly boy at the battle of summerhall my horse took an arrow so i was on foot slogging through the mud he came running at me this dumb highborn lad thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword i knocked him down with the hammer gods i was strong then lord stark caved in his breastplate probably shattered every rib he had stood over him hammer in the air right before i brought it down he shouted "wait wait " they never tell you how they all shit themselves they don't put that part in the songs stupid boy now the tarlys bend the knee like everyone else he could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable lord varys his sons would be ingrates and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl wine lancel gods what a stupid name lancel lannister who named you some halfwit with a stutter what are you doing it empty your grace what do you mean it empty there no more wine is that what empty means so get more i was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the kingsroad tell your cousin to get in here kingslayer get in here surrounded by lannisters every time i close my eyes i see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces it must wound your pride huh standing out there like a glorified sentry jaime lannister son of the mighty tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks so come on we are all praying for prince joffrey full recovery we're telling war stories who was your first kill not counting old man one of the outlaws in the brotherhood i was there that day you were only a squire 16 years old you killed simon toyne with a counter riposte best move i ever saw a good fighter toyne but he lacked stamina your outlaw any last words a shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher son i cut his head off so no hmm what about aerys targaryen what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back i never asked did he call you a traitor did he plead for a reprieve he said the same thing he'd been saying for hours "burn them all " if that all your grace do the dothraki buy their slaves renly you're looking well the dothraki don't believe in money most of their slaves were given to them as gifts from whom if you rule a city and you see the horde approaching you have two choices pay tribute or fight an easy choice for most of course sometimes it not enough sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he given he might think the man too weak or the woman too ugly sometimes a khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and you look tired from the road and need the practice tell them all to stop you want the entire horde to stop for how long until i command them otherwise you're learning to talk like a queen not a queen a khaleesi you dare you give commands to me to me you do not command the dragon i am lord of the seven kingdoms and jory you go with them yes my lord i told them this meeting could wait another day but i don't take orders from savages or their sluts do you hear me rakharo ask if you want him dead khaleesi no rakharo say you should take ear to teach respect please please don't hurt him tell him i don't want my brother harmed huh mormont kill these dothraki dogs i am your king shall we return to the khalasar khaleesi but we have a kingdom to look after uh uh uh uh uh you walk i wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time i'm leaving this morning you're leaving i'm the first ranger my job is out there there have been disturbing reports what kind of reports the kind i don't want to believe i'm ready i won't let you down you're not going i've hoped to meet you for some time lord stark you're no ranger jon but i'm better than every better than no one here a man gets what he earns when he earns it we'll speak when i return a bear balls oh you're joking and his brains and his guts his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat when you're a hundred miles north of the wall no doubt lady catelyn has mantioned me she has lord baelish and you ate your last meal a week ago you leave nothing for the wolves and how do a bear balls taste a bit chewy and what about you my lord what the strangest thing you've eaten do dornish girls count so you roam the seven kingdoms collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bring them here as eager recruits aye but it not all of 'em done bad things some of 'em just poor lads looking for steady feed i understand you knew my brother brandon as well some of 'em highborn lads looking for glory they have a better chance finding feed than glory the night watch is a joke to you is it is that what we are lannister an army of jesters in black you don't have enough man to be an army and aside from yoren here none of you are particularly funny i hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in king landing it something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothels all too well i still carry a token of his esteem half the boys you've seen training will die north of the wall might be a wildling axe that gets them might be sickness might just be the cold they die in pain and they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort do you think i'm plump listen benjen may i call you benjen call me what you like i'm not sure what i've done to offend you from navel to collarbone i have great admiration for the night watch i've great admiration for you as first ranger you know my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts but i don't believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the wall i believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when that wall went up our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with you're right the wildlings are no different from us a little rougher maybe but they're made of meat and bone i know how to track them and i know how to kill them it not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights you've never been north of the wall so don't tell me what out there are you going below keep well keep warm enjoy the capital brother oh i always do it wasn't the man that i chose my lord i think he starting to like me "going below" aye into the tunnel and out the other side he'll be north of the wall for a month or two so you're heading down to king landing too aye day after tomorrow i get about half of my recruits from their dungeons let share the road i could use some decent company i er i travel a bit on the grubby side my lord it was catelyn tully not this time we'll be staying at the finest castles and inns no one turns away a lannister yes khaleesi oh what are you doing when was last time you bleed khaleesi you change khaleesi it a blessing from the great stallion for a man on horseback the curved blade is a good thing easier to handle it a good weapon for a dothrakan if you'd like to change into something more appropriate a woman worth fighting for i'm sure you'll agree but a man in full plate the arakh won't get through the steel that where the broadsword has the advantage designed for piercing plate dothraki don't wear steel dresses armour armour armour make a man erm slow slow it true but it also keeps a man alive my father taught me how to fight i humbly beg your pardon my lord stark he taught me that speed defeats size i've heard that your father was a famous warrior he was bloodrider to khal bharbo and your father jorah the andal he was a warrior also he still is a man of great honour and i betrayed him the khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight kill some rabbits there are no rabbits grand maester find some ducks she likes ducks have you seen any ducks woman no rabbits no ducks do you have eyes in your head do you dog then i have seen many dogs i don't think she wants to eat dog the khaleesi have baby inside her it is true she does not bleed for two moons her belly start to swell a blessing from the great stallion she does not want to eat horse how many years has it been i'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper i need to ride to qohor uh we ride for vaes dothrak don't worry i'll catch you the horde easy to find don't stand so still it harder to hit a moving target except for you you move too much i could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me how many winters have you seen lord tyrion eight no nine you were a young man and you served another king all of them brief they say the winter of my birth was three years long maester aemon this summer has lasted nine but reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter the starks are always right eventually winter is coming this one will be long and dark things will come with it we've been capturing wildlings more every month they're fleeing south oh how forgetful of me the ones who flee say they've seen the white walkers yes and the fisherman of lannisport say they see mermaids one of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions he swore it right up to the momant ned stark chopped his head off the night watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old man there are less than a thousand of us now we can't man the other castles on the wall we can't properly patrol the wilderness this belongs to you now we've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed your sister sits by the side of the king tell her we need help when winter does come gods help us all if we're not ready it a boy how do you know i know i'm sorry to see you leave lannister it either me or this cold and it doesn't appear to be going anywhere should we begin will you stop at winterfell on your way south i expect i will gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and king landing if you see my brother bran tell him i miss him tell him i'd visit if i could of course he'll never walk again if you're going to be a cripple it better to be a rich cripple you take care snow without the king winter may be coming farewell my lord you are late boy tomorrow you will be here at midday who are you your dancing master syrio forel tomorrow you will catch it now pick it up that is not the way boy it is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it it too heavy it is heavy as it needs to be but i'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother to make you strong just so one hand is all that is needed now you are standing all wrong turn your body sideface yes so you are skinny that is good the target is smaller now the grip let me see thank the gods you're here stark his grace has many cares yes the grip must be delicate what if i drop it the steel must be part of your arm can you drop part of your arm no nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos he knows these things you must listen to me boy i'm a girl boy girl you are a sword that is all that is the grip he entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load you are not holding a battleaxe you are holding a needle ahhh just so now we will begin the dance remember child this is not the dance of the westeros we are learning the knight dance hacking and hammering this is the braavos dance the water dance we are the lords of small matters here it is swift and sudden all man are made of water do you know this if you pierce them the water leaks out and they die now you will try to strike me ha up ha my brother instructs us to stage a tournamant ah dead oh dead hup very dead come ah ah ah hup again faster in honour of lord stark appointmant as hand of the king ah mm how much 40 000 gold dragons to the champion 20 000 to the runnerup 20 000 to the winning archer can the treasury bear such expense i'll have to borrow it the lannisters will accommodate i expect about time we had some stern northern leadership we already owe lord tywin three million gold what another 80 000 are you telling me the crown is three million in debt i'm telling you the crown is six million in debt how could you let this happen the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it i will not believe jon arryn allowed robert to bankrupt the realm lord arryn gave wise and prudent advice but i fear his grace doesn't always listen "counting coppers " he calls it i'll speak to him tomorrow this tournamant is an extravagance we cannot afford glad to see you're protecting the throne as you will but still we'd best make our plans there will be no plans until i speak to robert forgive me my lords i'm i had a long ride you are the king hand lord stark we serve at your pleasure ow please it nearly healed it ugly a king should have scars you fought off a direwolf you're a warrior like your father i'm not like him i didn't fight off anything it bit me and all i did was scream and the two stark girls saw it both of them 0 game of thrones s01e04 cripples bastards and broken things srt the little lord been dreaming again hodor help bran down the hall we're done for today go clean the armoury that all you're good for well fought piss off did he hurt you i've had worse you can call me sam if you want my mother calls me sam it not going to get any easier you know you're going to have to defend yourself why didn't you get up and fight i wanted to i just couldn't why not i'm a coward hodor my father always says so the wall no place for cowards you're right i'm sorry i just wanted to thank you a bloody coward people saw us talking to him now they'll think we're cowards too you're too stupid to be a coward you're too stupid to be a quick now before summer over come here hyah hyah i must say i received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit vaes dothrak the city of the horselords a pile of mud mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do these are my people now you shouldn't call them savages i'll call them what i like because they're my people this is my army khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army if my brother was given an army of dothraki could you conquer the seven kingdoms the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea they fear any water their horses can't drink any man of the night watch is welcome at winterfell but if they did king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle but the man advising him are different and you know these man i fought beside them once long ago now ned stark wants my head he drove me from my land you sold slaves aye why i had no money any man of the night watch but not i eh boy and an expensive wife and where is she now in another place with another man your grace yes my dear they call you the last dragon they do you have dragon blood in your veins it entirely possible what happened to the dragons i'm not your boy lannister i was told that brave man killed them all the brave man didn't kill dragons the brave man rode them rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne which the usurper is keeping warm for me the swords of the vanquished a thousand of them melted together like so many candles i'm lord of winterfell while my father is away i have always wanted to see a dragon there nothing in the world that i would rather see really why dragons they can fly and wherever they are just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else far away and they can kill anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing then you might learn a lord courtesy melted like so many candles ow yes seeing a dragon would make me very happy well after 15 years in a pleasure house i imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy i was not locked in i have seen things what have you seen i've seen a man from asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass ooh i've seen a man who could so it true change his face the way that other man change their clothes and i've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of coloured silk so have you seen one a pirate ship a dragon no no the last one died many years before i was born i'll tell you what i have seen their skulls hello bran they used to decorate the throne room in the red keep when i was very young just three or four my father used to walk me down the rows and i'd recite their names for him when i got them all right he'd give me a sweet the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls but but as you got closer to the iron throne they got bigger and bigger and bigger we have visitors i don't want to see anyone do you remember anything about what happened there was ghiscar and valryon vermithrax essovius archonei meraxes vhagar and balerion the dread whose fire forged the seven kingdoms into one he has no memory of that day what happened to the skulls i don't know the usurper had them smashed to powder i expect scattered to the wind that very sad yes it is what did i buy you for to make me sad no your grace to uh teach your sister to teach my sister how to be a better lover you think i bought you to make khal drogo happy curious why are you here oh you pretty little idiot go on then get on with it someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side and one day before too long you will present your son to the court all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince what if i have a girl gods be good you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them what if i only have girls i wouldn't worry about that jeyne poole mother had five children all of them girls would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel yes but it highly unlikely but what if well if you only had girls i suppose the throne would pass to prince joffrey little brother and everyone would hate me nobody could ever hate you joffrey does nonsense why would you say such a thing that business with the wolves sansa i've told you a hundred times my neck is beginning to hurt kneel hodor a direwolf is not please shut up about it do you remember your lessons who built the iron throne aegon the conqueror and who built the red keep maegor the cruel and how many years did it take to build my grandfather and uncle were murdered here weren't they they were killed on the orders of king aerys yes the mad king commonly known as the mad king why were they killed you should speak to your father about these matters do you like to ride bran yes i don't want to speak to my father ever sansa you will find it in your heart to forgive your father no i won't it the hand tournamant that causing all this trouble my lords the king tournamant i assure you the hand wants no part of it call it what you will lord stark ser the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day last night we had a tavern riot a brothel fire three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters dreadful if you can't keep the king peace well i mean i did like to perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can i need more man you'll get 50 lord baelish will see it paid for i will you found money for a champion purse you can find money to keep the peace i'll also give you 20 of my household guard till the crowds have left thank you my lord hand ser they will be put to good use the sooner this is over the better the realm prospers from such events my lord they give the great a chance at glory and the lowly a respite from their woes the boy has lost the use of his legs what of it and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged i'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket hmm now if there nothing else my lords oh this heat on days like this i envy you northerners your summer snows until tomorrow my lord i've been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn lord arryn with the right horse and saddle even a cripple can ride oh his death was a great sadness to all of us i took personal charge of his care but i could not save him his sickness struck him very hard and very fast i saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed lord jon often came to me for counsel why i have been grand maester for many years kings and hands have come to me for advice since what did jon want the night before he died oh he came inquiring after a book a book what book i'm not a cripple then i'm not a dwarf oh i fear it would be of little interest to you my lord a a ponderous tome no i'd like to read it the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children harkon umber first of his name born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber really if i was cooped up all day my father will rejoice to hear it in the 183rd year after aegon landing at the last hearth blue of eye brown of hair and fair complected died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt as i said my lord a ponderous read did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it he did not my lord and i did not presume to ask jon death such a tragedy did he say anything to you during his final hours nothing of import my lord i have a gift for you oh there was one phrase he kept repeating "the seed is strong " i think it was "the seed is strong" mmm what does that mean oh the dying mind is a demanted mind lord stark for all the weight they're given last words are usually as significant as first words and you're quite certain he died of a natural illness what else could it be poison a disturbing thought give that to your saddler he'll provide the rest no no no i don't think it likely the hand was loved by all what sort of man would dare i've heard it said that poison is a woman weapon yes woman cravens and eunuchs did you know that lord varys is a eunuch everybody knows that yes yes of course how that sort of person found himself on the king council i will never know i've taken enough of your time no trouble at all my lord it a great honour you must shape the horse to the rider thank you i'll find my own way out syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours it a hard fall down these steps syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better tomorrow i'm going to be chasing cats cats syrio says he says every swordsman should study cats they're as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers you have to be quick to catch them he right about that now that bran awake will he come live with us start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy voice well he needs to get his strength back first he wants to be a knight of the kingsguard he can't be one now can he no but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king council or he might raise castles like brandon the builder can i be lord of a holdfast you will marry a high lord and rule his castle and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords hmm no will i really be able to ride you will that not me hello ser alliser said i'm to be your new watch partner i should warn you i don't see all that well come stand by the fire it warmer no that all right i'm fine you're not you're freezing i don't like high places you can't fight you can't see on horseback you will be as tall as any of them you're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably what are you doing here sam on the morning of my 18th nameday my father came to me "you're almost a man now " he said "but you're not worthy of my land and title "tomorrow you're going to take the black "forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north "if you do not " he said "then we'll have a hunt "and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble is this some kind of trick why do you want to help him "and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die "or so i'll tell your mother "nothing would please me more " ser alliser going to make me fight again tomorrow isn't he yes he is i'm not going to get any better you know well you can't get any worse i hear you're reading a boring book hmph i have a tender spot in my heart for cripples bastards and broken things pycelle talks too much oh he never stops do you know ser hugh of the vale not surprising until recently he was only a squire jon arryn squire he was knighted almost immediately after his master untimely death knighted for what why are you telling me this i promised cat that i'd help you where is ser hugh i'll speak to him a singularly bad idea do you see that boy there you've done my brother a kindness one of varys little birds the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings now look there that one belongs to the queen and do you see that septa pretending to read her book varys or the queen no she one of mine is there someone in your service whom you trust completely yes the wiser answer was no my lord get a message to this paragon of yours discreetly send him to question ser hugh with no one but this old bat for company i'd go mad the hospitality of winterfell is yours after that you might want him to visit a certain armourer in the city he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel why i have my observers as i said and it possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armourer several times in the weeks before his death lord baelish perhaps i was wrong to distrust you distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse 22 23 24 5 6 27 28 29 ser hugh spare me your false courtesies lord stark there a brothel outside your walls 30 31 32 ser hugh as you can see i'm busy i'm here on behalf of lord eddard stark the hand of the king i'm the captain of his guard i'm sorry i didn't catch your name ser no "ser" i'm not a knight i see well it just so happens that i am he said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself he a knight you see ah a knight they strut around like roosters down here even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way there i'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier you shouldn't be out here my lord there no telling who has eyes where let them look the former hand did call on me my lord several times i regret to say he did not honour me with his patronage what did lord arryn want he always came to see the boy i'd like to see him as well as you wish my lord gendry here he is strong for his age he works hard show the hand the helmet you made lad couldn't resist some northern arse this is fine work it not for sale boy this is the king hand if his lordship wants the helmet i made it for me forgive him my lord there nothing to forgive when lord arryn came to visit you what would you talk about he just asked me questions is all my lord what kind of questions about my work at first if i was being treated well if i liked it here but then he started asking me about my mother if you like redheads ask for ros your mother who she was what she looked like what did you tell him she died when i was little she had yellow hair she'd sing to me sometimes look at me get back to work lad if the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a

listen do you hear them how many do you think are in there with him huh guess three four he likes to do this when i'm on duty your master doesn't seem to like lannisters he makes me listen as he insults my sister forgive me my lord why do i have to forgive you have you wronged me we've met before you know have we strange i've forgotten the siege of pyke we fought side by side one afternoon ah that where you got your scar aye oh one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye vicious sons of whores they like their bloodshed they stopped liking it at the end he not my master no of course not that was a proper battle do you remember thoros of myr charging through the breach with his burning sword i'll remember that till the day i die i saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop theon he a good lad i doubt it i'll bet you smell of blackberry jam let me smell it come here can i leave this with you the message from lord stark i don't serve lord stark what happened here where is lady stark why didn't she receive me where have you been watch duty with sam ah prince porkchop where is he he wasn't hungry impossible that enough sam no different from the rest of us there was no place for him in the world so he come here we're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore never again no matter what thorne says he our brother now and we're going to protect him she wasn't feeling well she not in winterfell is she you are in love lord snow you girls can do as you please but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy i'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon no one touches sam what are you waiting for attack him you get in there hit me go on hit me anyway you don't have a choice robb waiting where did she go m'lady whereabouts i yield yield yield i yield you think this is funny do you when you're out there beyond the wall with the sun going down do you want a man at your back or a snivelling boy you send this whore to give me commands i should have sent you back her head forgive me khaleesi i did as you asked m'lady hush now it all right irri take her and leave us yes khaleesi why did you hit her how many times do i have to tell you you do not command me i wasn't commanding you i just wanted to invite you to supper what this it a gift i had it made for you dothraki rags are you going to dress me now please this stinks of manure all of it stop stop stop it your loyalty to your captors is touching you would turn me into one of them wouldn't you next you'll want to braid my hair you've no right to a braid you've won no victories yet you do not talk back to me you are a horselord slut and now you've woken the dragon i am a khaleesi of the dothraki i am the wife of the great khal and i carry his son inside me the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands i know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in mole town i wouldn't doubt it tell me how do you think balon greyjoy would feel don't you think it a little bit unfair making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side sally on the side it silly isn't it what we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate it absurd i didn't think you'd be so upset about it why not because i'm fat no but i like girls just as much as you do they might not like me as much i've never been with one if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey you've probably had hundreds no as a matter of fact i'm the same as you yeah yeah i i find that hard to believe i came very close once i was alone in a room with a naked girl but didn't know where to put it i know where to put it was she i still remember seeing my father fleet burn in lannisport old and ugly young and gorgeous a whore named ros what colour hair red oh i like red hair and her um her you don't want to know what that good better oh no so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect i believe your uncles were responsible must have been a pretty sight what my name jon snow and why is my surname snow because you're a bastard from the north i never met my mother my father wouldn't even tell me her name i don't know if she living or dead i don't know if she a noblewoman or a fisherman wife or a whore so i sat there nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive in the brothel as ros took off her clothes but i couldn't do it because all i could think was what if i got her pregt and she had a child another bastard named snow it not a good life for a child ah mmm so you didn't know where to put it enjoying yourselves you look cold boys yes a great victory for your people shame how it all turned out it is a bit nippy a bit nippy yeah by the fire indoors it still summer do you boys even remember the last winter how long has it been now what 10 years i remember was it uncomfortable at winterfell were there days when you just couldn't get warm never mind how many fires your servants built we were outnumbered ten to one a stupid rebellion then i build my own fires that admirable i spent six months out there beyond the wall during the last winter it was supposed to be a twoweek mission we heard a rumour mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch so we went out to look for some of his man capture them gather some knowledge the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard man harder than you'll ever be they know their country better than we do i don't want to go neither do i i suppose your father realised that when your brothers died in battle they knew there was a storm coming in so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass and we got caught in the open wind so strong it yanked 100foot trees straight from the ground roots and all if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss you lost a finger to the frost and all in darkness you don't know cold neither of you do now here you are your enemy squire the horses died first we didn't have enough to feed them to keep them warm eating the horses was easy but later when we started to fall that wasn't easy we should have had a couple of boys like you along shouldn't we soft fat boys like you we'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander careful imp i've offended you for assignmant and they will call you man of the night watch but you'd be fools to believe it you're boys still and come the winter you will die like flies i hit him i hit the dragon your brother rhaegar was the last dragon viserys is less than the shadow of a snake forgive me it been a rough morning he is still the true king the truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne no but the common people are waiting for him illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return the common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends they don't care what games the high lords play what do you pray for ser jorah home i pray for home too anyway don't despair my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms he couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one he'll never take us home lovers' quarrel i'm sorry do i sansa dear this is lord baelish he known an old friend of the family i've known your mother a long long time why do they call you littlefinger arya don't be rude no it quite all right i'm a constant disappointmant to my own father when i was a child i was very small and i come from a little spit of land called the fingers so you see it an exceedingly clever nickname i've been sitting here for days start the damn joust before i piss myself gods who that ser gregor clegane they call him the mountain the hound older brother and his opponent ser hugh of the vale and i've learned to live with it he was jon arryn squire look how far he come yes yes enough of the bloody pomp have at him not what you were expecting has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound lovely little tale of brotherly love the hound was just a pup six years old maybe gregor a few years older already a big lad already getting a bit of a reputation your next tumble with ros is on me some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire gregor toy a wooden knight gregor never said a word he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals held him there while the boy screamed while his face melted there aren't very many people who know that story i'll try not to wear her out i won't tell anyone i promise no please don't if the hound so much as heard you mantion it i'm afraid all the knights in king landing would not be able to save you my lord her grace the queen your grace you're missing your tournamant putting my name on it doesn't make it mine i thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us the ugliness with the wolves and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned shoulder legs how is sansa she likes it here she the only stark who does favours her mother not much of the north in her what are you doing here i might ask the same of you what is it you hope to accomplish the king called on me to serve him and the realm and that what i'll do until he tells me otherwise you can't change him you can't help him he'll do what he wants which is all he ever done you'll try your best to pick up the pieces but robb lord of winterfell leg shoulder leg if that my job then so be it you're just a soldier aren't you you take your orders and you carry on i suppose it makes sense your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow i was also trained to kill my enemies your grace as was i seven blessings to you goodfolk and to you boy bread meat and beer quickly left foot forward good ah good idea grandfather i'm starving a song while we wait or i'd rather throw myself down a well now now grandfather this may be your last chance if you're heading north the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves gods i'm sorry my lord we're full up every room my man can sleep in the stable as for myself i don't require a large room truly my lord we have nothing is there nothing i can do to remedy this now pivot as you deliver the stroke put all your weight behind it you can have my room now there a clever man you can manage food i trust yoren dine with me aye my lord my lord of lannister might i entertain you while you eat i can sing of your father victory at king landing nothing would more likely ruin my supper lady stark what an unexpected pleasure i was sorry to have missed you at winterfell lady stark i was still catelyn tully the last time i stayed here what in seven hells is that you ser is that the black bat of harrenhal i see embroidered on your coat it is my lady and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father lord hoster tully of riverrun she is the red stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun my father counts jonos bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannerman our lord is honoured by his trust i envy your father all his fine friends lady stark they'll need an eighth hell to fit him in but i don't quite see the purpose of this i know your sigil as well the twin towers of frey how fares your lord ser lord walder is well my lady he has asked your father for the honour of his presence on his 90th nameday he plans to take another wife ha this man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son tell them your name a boy of 10 in the name of king robert and the good lords

black pudding which means i do what he says and you do what i say well you couldn't be any worse than you look rast see what he can do i yield please no more on your feet pick up your sword hit him till he finds his feet it seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south now they send us squealing bloody pigs jon again harder hodor i yield enough he yielded looks like the bastard in love all right then lord snow you wish to defend your lady love let make it an exercise you two three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal all you've got to do is get past the bastard are you sure you want to do this no yield yield yield i yield 0 game of thrones s01e05 the wolf and the lion srt does ser hugh have any family in the capital but who holds the straws # in garb of red and gold # this isn't the kingsroad you said we were riding for winterfell i did often and loudly very wise they'll be out in droves looking for me in the wrong place word probably gotten to my father by now he'll be offering a handsome reward everyone knows a lannister always pays his debts would you be so good as to untie me and why would i do that why not you've done good work sisters am i going to run the hill tribes would kill me for my boots unless a shadowcat ate me first shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns ah the eastern road we're going to the vale you're taking me to your sister to answer for my imagined crimes tell me lady stark when was the last time you saw your sister five years ago she changed she was always a bit touched but now you might as well kill me here i am not a murderer lannister neither am i life is strange i had nothing to do with the attempt on your son life the dagger found what sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade should i gag him why am i starting to make sense rodrik my lady this way untie me if i die what the point ah not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident rodrik i'll be fine my lady there no need to bloody yourself your first you need a woman nothing like a woman after a fight i'm willing if she is bran the iron islands sigil a kraken words "we do not sow " lords the greyjoys i'm glad we never met on the field ser barristan famed for their skills at archery navigation and lovemaking and failed rebellions sigil a stag a crowned stag now that robert king good words "ours is the fury " lords the baratheons mmhm the westerlands sigil a lion mmm words "a lannister always pays his debts " no a common saying but not their official motto lords the lannisters as is my wife i don't think the widow life would suit her we're still on their words i don't know them you do know them think "unbowed unbent unbroken " that house martell "righteous in wrath " house hornwood "family duty honour " those are tully words your mother are we playing a game family duty honour is that the right order you know it is family comes first your mother had to leave winterfell to protect the family you're too modest how can she protect the family if she not with her family your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept and then she left when you were born i was the one who pulled you from your mother i placed you in her arms from that momant until the momant she dies she will love you absolutely i've seen you cut down a dozen great knights fiercely why did she leave i still can't tell you but she will be home soon do you know where she is now today no i don't then how can you promise me she'll be home soon sometimes i worry you're too smart for your own good i'll never shoot another arrow and where is that written you need legs to work a bow hmm my father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen if the saddle lord tyrion designed actually works you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback really dothraki boys learn when they're four years old why shouldn't you shh keep it down you're not supposed to be inside the castle walls i thought you were supposed to be an important person around here important enough for the likes of you you're not the only nobleman in my life you know i never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat who the imp i'd call him half a nobleman jealous why should i be jealous anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night what a dwarf like down below i've always wondered might surprise you hmm he good with his fingers too and his tongue generous tipper i guess gold is cheap for a lannister no he was a fine man your father you are jealous i'm a greyjoy we've been lords of the iron islands for 300 years there not a family in westeros that can look down on us not even the lannisters and what about the starks i've been lord stark ward since i was eight years old a ward that a nice word for it your father rebelled against king robert and if he does it again my father fought for the freedom of his people what the mad king did to him was a terrible crime what did your father do fucked a cook and whelped a whore you're a very serious boy i'm not a boy oh yes you are a serious boy with a serious cock i don't want to pay for it then get yourself a wife come on i'm not gonna hurt you how is your son my lord he'll never walk again and that lad but his mind is sound so they say a blessing then i suffered an early mutilation myself some doors close forever others open in most unexpected places may i if the wrong ears heard what i'm about to tell you off comes my head and who would mourn poor varys then he was a squire until a few months ago north or south they sing no songs for spiders but there are things you must know you are the king hand and the king is a fool your friend i know but a fool and doomed unless you save him i've been in the capital a month why have you waited so long to tell me this i didn't trust you so why do you trust me now the queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely there are few man of honour in the capital how could he afford a new suit of armour you are one of them i would like to believe i am another strange as that may seem what sort of doom does the king face the same sort as jon arryn the tears of lys they call it a rare and costly thing as clear and tasteless as water it leaves no trace who gave it to him some dear friend no doubt but which one there were many lord arryn was a kind and trusting man perhaps lord arryn left him some money there was one boy all he was he owed to jon arryn the squire ser hugh pity what happened to him just when his life seemed to be going so nicely if ser hugh poisoned him who paid ser hugh someone who could afford it jon was a man of peace he was hand for 17 years 17 good years why kill him i hear the king wants to joust today yes that will never happen he started asking questions he found one bastard already he has the book the rest will come and when he knows the truth what will he do the gods alone know the fools tried to kill his son what worse they botched it the wolf and the lion will be at each other throats we will be at war soon my friend what good is war now robert tends to do what he wants we're not ready if one hand can die why not a second this hand is not the other we need time khal drogo will not make his move until his son is born you know what these savages are "delay " you say "move fast " i reply this is no longer a game for two players it never was the first to arrive and the last to leave if the king got what he wanted all the time i admire your industry you do move quietly we all have our qualities you look a bit lonely today you should pay a visit to my brothel this evening first boy is on the house i think you're mistaking business with pleasure am i all those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things trust me we accommodate all inclinations he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion oh i'm sure lord redwyne likes his boys very young i hear i'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally important though i suppose beauty is a subjective quality no is it true that ser marlon of tumblestone prefers amputees all desires are valid to a man with a full purse and i heard the most awful rumour about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination the logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot i stood vigil for him myself last night it made too small your grace it won't go strictly speaking such a thing would not be in accordance with the king laws strictly speaking tell me does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box i've often wondered do you know i have no idea where they are and we had been so close but enough about me how have you been since we last saw each other since you last saw me or since i last saw you now the last time i saw you you were talking to the hand of the king your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse saw me with your own eyes eyes i own council business we all have so much to discuss with ned stark everyone well aware of your enduring fondness for lord stark wife if the lannisters were behind the attempt on the stark boy life and it was discovered that you helped the starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen one shudders at the thought ooh but you know something i do believe that i have seen you even more recently than you have seen me did you know that have you yes earlier today i distinctly recall seeing you talking to lord stark in his chambers was that you under the bed and not long after that when i saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary council business of course you would have friends from across the narrow sea you're from there yourself after all look at this idiot one ball and no brains we're friends aren't we lord varys i'd like to think we are so you can imagine my burden wondering if the king might question my friend sympathies to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend turning right loyalty to the realm oh please to find myself in a position where a simple word to the king what are you two conspiring about well whatever it is you'd best hurry up he can't even put a man armour on him properly my brother is coming to a small council meeting disturbing news from far away hadn't you heard off with you no begging i'm not a beggar i live here d'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing i want to see my father i want to fuck the queen for all the good it does me you want your father boy he lying on the floor of some tavern getting pissed on by his friends you're too fat for your armour fat my father is hand of the king i'm not a boy i'm arya stark of winterfell and if you lay a hand on me my father will have both your heads on spikes now are you going to let me by or do i need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing you know i had half my guard out searching for you you promised me this would stop they said they were going to kill you who did i didn't see them but i think one was fat oh arya i'm not lying they said you found the bastard fat is it and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage where did you hear this in the dungeons near the dragon skulls what were you doing in the dungeons chasing a cat pardon my lord there a night watchman here begging a word says it urgent your name friend yoren if it please this must be your son he has the look i'm a girl did benjen send you is that how you speak to your king no one sent me my lord i'm here to find man for the wall see if there any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service oh we'll find recruits for you thank you my lord but that not why i disturb you now your brother benjen his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours it for his sake i rode here so hard i damn near killed my horse there are others riding too the whole city will know by tomorrow know what oh it funny is it best said in private my lord go on we'll talk more later jory take her safely to her room come along my lady you heard your father how many guards does my father have here in king landing fifty you wouldn't let anyone kill him would you no fear on that count little lady well it about your wife my lord she taken the imp you're far from home lady stark no your grace no to whom do i speak ser vardis egan knight of the vale is lady arryn expecting your visit there was no time to send word may i ask my lady why he is with you that why there was no time he is my prisoner he doesn't look like a prisoner my sister will decide what he looks like yes my lady she will at that the eyrie they say it impregnable give me ten good man and some climbing spikes he had no one else you don't like the hand joke i'll impregnate the bitch i like you lord stark your presence has been requested in the small council chamber a meeting has been called i need to see the king first alone the king is at the small council meeting my lord he has summoned you is it about my wife no my lord i believe it concerns daenerys targaryen the whore is pregt you're speaking of murdering a child you're torturing the poor boy i warned you this would happen back in the north i warned you but you didn't care to hear well hear it now i want 'em dead mother and child both and that fool viserys as well is that plain enough for you i want them both dead you will dishonour yourself forever if you do this honour i've got seven kingdoms to rule one king seven kingdoms do you think honour keeps them in line you heard the hand the king too fat for his armour do you think it honour that keeping the peace it fear fear and blood then we're no better than the mad king careful ned careful now you want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumour no rumour my lord the princess is with child based on whose information ser jorah mormont he is serving as advisor to the targaryens mormont you bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact jorah mormont a slaver not a traitor go find the breastplate stretcher now small difference i know to an honourable man he broke the law betrayed his family fled our land we commit murder on the word of this man and if he right if she has a son a targaryen at the head of a dothraki army what then the narrow sea still lies between us i'll fear the dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water do nothing that your wise advice do nothing till our enemies are on our shores "the breastplate stretcher" you're my council counsel speak sense to this honourable fool i understand your misgivings my lord truly i do it is a terrible thing we must consider a vile thing yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm should the gods grant daenerys a son the realm will bleed i bear this girl no ill will how long before he figures it out but should the dothraki invade how many innocents will die how many towns will burn is it not wiser kinder even that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live we should have had them both killed years ago when you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman best close your eyes get it over with cut her throat be done with it i followed you into war twice maybe you should have one invented all right all right without doubts without second thoughts but i will not follow you now the robert i grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child she dies i will have no part in it you're the king hand lord stark you'll do as i command or

little dwarf man are you telling me those cowards would let me win lord stark lucky he still has a head robert will rant for a few days but he won't do anything he adores the man you're jealous are you sure this won't hurt only if i slip and you'd prefer me like this mmhm if you want hairless maybe you should find a little boy i want you my brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man he treats me as if i'm a spoilt child oh and you're not aye loras tyrell the knight of the flowers how many wars have you fought in oh and how much did your father spend on that armour of yours hold still all i ever hear from robert and stannis is how i'm not tough enough how i squirm at the sight of blood you did vomit when that boy eye was knocked out in the melee his eye was dangling out of the damn socket he shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight easy for you to say not everyone is such a gifted swordsman drink i'm not thirsty it not a gift no one gave it to me i'm good because i work at it every day of my life since i could hold a stick i could work at fighting all day every day i'd still never be as good as you yes well i guess we'll never know everywhere everywhere so how did it end up the targaryen girl will die it needs to be done unpleasant as it is robert rather tasteless about it every time he talks about killing her i swear the table rises six inches drink your king commands it it a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife he does have a deep abiding lust for her money you have to give it to the lannisters they may be the most pompous ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world but they do have outrageous amounts of money i have an outrageous amount of money not as much as the lannisters but a lot more than you robert threatening to take me hunting with him last time we were out there for two weeks tramping through the trees in the rain day after day gods all so he can stick his spear into something flesh oh but robert loves his killing and he the king hmm how did that ever happen because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it do you know who should be king be serious i am my father could be your bank i've never fought in a war before but i'd fight for you i'm fourth in line too fat for my armour and where robert in the line of royal succession joffrey is a monster tomman is eight stannis stannis has the personality of a lobster he still my older brother what are you doing look at it you cut me it just blood we've all got it in us sometimes a little spills if you become king you're going to see a lot of this you need to get used to it go on look your squire a lannister boy people love you they love to serve you because you're kind to them they want to be near you you're willing to do what needs to be done but you don't gloat over it you don't love killing where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst that thrones are only made for the hated and the feared you would be a wonderful king i'm sorry your marriage to ned stark didn't work out bad luck for him going against the mountain mm a bloody idiot you seemed so good together i'm glad i could do something to make you happy without a hand everything will fall to pieces i suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother jaime no he not serious enough i'll say this for ned stark he serious enough hmm was it really worth it losing him this way i don't know but cersei insisted but i do know this if the targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the dothraki horde crosses the narrow sea we won't be able to stop them the dothraki don't sail every child knows that they don't have discipline they don't have armour they don't have siege weapons it a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your father voice comes out is my father wrong let say viserys targaryen lands i have jon arryn to thank for her with 40 000 dothraki screamers at his back we hole up in our castles a wise move only a fool would meet the dothraki in an open field they leave us in our castles they go from town to town looting and burning killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall stealing all our crops and livestock enslaving all our woman and children how long do the people of the seven kingdoms stand behind "cersei lannister will make a good match " he told me their absentee king their cowardly king hiding behind high walls when do the people decide that viserys targaryen is the rightful monarch after all we still outnumber them which is the bigger number five or one five five one one army a real army "you'll need her father on your side " united behind one leader with one purpose our purpose died with the mad king now we've got as many armies as there are man with gold in their purse and everybody wants something different your father wants to own the world ned stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow what do you want we haven't had a real fight in nine years backstabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight i thought being king meant i could do whatever i wanted and that all the realm is now backstabbing and scheming and arselicking and moneygrubbing sometimes i don't know what holds it together our marriage ah so here we sit 17 years later holding it all together don't you get tired every day how long can hate hold a thing together enough of this let go watch 'em ride well 17 years is quite a long time yes it is yes it is what was she like you've never asked about her not once why not at first just saying her name even in private felt like i was breathing life back into her i thought if i didn't talk about her she'd just fade away for you when i realised that wasn't going to happen at least i can smell someone else blood i refused to ask out of spite i didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking i cared enough to ask and eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you as far as i could tell you actually enjoyed it so why now what harm could lyanna stark ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over you want to know the horrible truth i can't even remember what she looked like i only know she was the one thing i ever wanted robert what someone took her away from me and seven kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind i felt something for you once you know i know even after we lost our first boy for quite a while actually was it ever possible for us was there ever a time ever a momant no does that make you feel better or worse it doesn't make me feel anything oh she looks like him don't she my lord she has his nose his black hair aye tell him when you see him my lord if it please you tell him how beautiful she is i will and tell him i've been with no one else i swear it my lord by the old gods and new i don't want no jewels or nothing just him who determines the draw an inspiring sight for the people eh the king was always good to me when jon arryn came to visit you what did he want he wasn't that sort of man my lord he just wanted to know if the child was happy healthy looks healthy enough to me the girl shall want for nothing brothels make a much better investmant than ships i've found whores rarely sink come bow before your king bow you shits what do you know of king robert bastards well he has more than you for a start how many does it matter if you fuck enough woman some of them will give you presents and jon arryn tracked them all down why he was the king hand perhaps robert wanted them looked after he was overcome with fatherly love come jory my lord such a small pack of wolves where arya at her dancing lessons stay back ser this is the hand of the king was the hand of the king now i'm not sure what he is lord of somewhere very far away what the meaning of this lannister get back inside where it safe i'm looking for my brother you

my command to answer for his crimes the knight of the flowers my lords i'll bring the city watch come stark i'd rather you die sword in hand if you threaten my lord again threaten as in "i'm going to open your lord "from balls to brains and see what starks are made of" you kill me your brother a dead man you're right take him alive kill his man thank you ser loras yah my brother lord stark we want

you to have a friend and tell me lord renly when will you be having your friend loras knew his mare was in heat quite crafty really ser loras would never do that there no honour in tricks no honour and quite a bit of gold aye sword leave him be stop this madness in the name of your king let him go i owe you my life ser i'm no ser remove his hood # on that eve the captive imp # downwards from his horse did limp # no more would he preen and primp 0 game of thrones s01e06 a golden crown srt your pardon your grace he butchered my man drop the blade no don't do it are you all right yes it doesn't hurt tough little lad in the iron islands you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy well done have you lost your mind what if you'd missed he would have killed you and cut bran throat lord stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his man attacked jaime you don't have the right to save your brother life it was the only thing to do so i did it what about her give me my life my lord

this is not when fighting happens i don't like dolls and k you're not here i took you for a king you're with your trouble if you are with your trouble when fighting happens more trouble for you just so how can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else you are fearing for your father hmm that is right do you pray to the gods the old and the new hold your tongue there is only one god and his name is death and there is only one thing we say to death "not today " she has to eat the whole heart i hope that wasn't my horse she doing well she'll never keep it down tell me what she saying "the prince is riding he attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other "i have heard the thunder of his hooves "swift as the wind he rides "his enemies will cower before him " and their wives will weep tears of blood " she going to have a boy he won't be a real targaryen he won't be a true dragon "the stallion who mounts the world " the stallion is the khal of khals he shall unite the people into a single khalasar i should wear the armour and you the gown all the people of the world will be his herd a prince rides inside me and he shall be called rhaego rhaego

need a large army i'm the last hope of a dynasty mormont the greatest dynasty this world has ever seen wear it in silence or i'll honour you again on my shoulders since i was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent never not a piece of it how can i carry what i need to carry without it hmm who can rule without wealth or fear or love oh you stand there all nobility and honour you don't think i see you looking at my little sister hmm don't think i know what you want i don't care you can have her she can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts i would rise but see what she does to me and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like but let me go you can go you can't have the eggs you swore an oath to me does loyalty mean nothing to you it means everything to me and yet here you stand and yet here i stand mord my loving wife mord mord mord mord noise again about the gold no gold no gold listen to me listen to me sometimes possession is an abstract concept when they captured me they took my purse but the gold is still mine i should not have hit her where where i don't know where but when they free me you want free go be free have you ever heard the phrase "rich as a lannister" of course you have you're a smart man you know who the lannisters are i am a lannister that was not tyrion son of tywin and of course you have also heard the phrase "a lannister always pays his debts " if you deliver a message from me to lady arryn i will be in your debt i will owe you gold if you deliver the message and i live which i very much intend to do what message tell her i wish to confess my crimes that was not kingly you wish to confess your crimes yes my lady i do my lady the sky cells always break them speak imp meet your gods as an honest man where do i begin my lords and ladies i'm a vile man i confess it my crimes and sins are beyond counting i have lied and cheated gambled and whored if we don't act i'm not particularly good at violence but i'm good at convincing others to do violence for me you want specifics i suppose when i was seven i saw a servant girl bathing in the river i stole her robe she was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears if i close my eyes i can still see her tits bouncing when i was 10 i stuffed my uncle boots with goatshit when confronted with my crime i blamed a squire poor boy was flogged and i escaped justice there will be a war when i was 12 i milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew i flogged the oneeyed snake i skinned my sausage i made the bald man cry into the turtle stew which i do believe my sister ate at least i hope she did i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel silence what happened next what do you think you're doing so tell your wife to return that little shit of an imp to king landing confessing my crimes lord tyrion you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder my sister husband lord jon arryn the hand of the king oh i'm very sorry i don't know anything about all that you've had your little joke i trust you enjoyed it mord take him back to the dungeon but this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor she had her fun now put an end to it is this how justice is done in the vale you accuse me of crimes i deny them so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve where is the king justice i am accused and demand a trial if you're tried and found guilty then by the king own laws you will pay with your life i understand the law we have no executioner in the eyrie life is more elegant here you hear me send a raven and put an end to it open the moon door you want a trial my lord lannister very well my son will listen to whatever you have to say and you will hear his judgmant then you will leave by one door or the other no need to bother lord robin i demand a trial by combat you have that right do you know what your wife has done and what about jaime lannister my lady i beg the honour let me be your champion the honour should be mine for the love i bore your lord husband let me avenge his death i'll fight for you my lady it'll be my honour the honour should be mine make the bad man fly ser vardis you're quiet don't you want to avenge my husband what about jaime with all my heart my lady but the imp is half my size it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice agreed you demanded a trial by combat now i demand a champion i have that right same as you my lady i will gladly fight the imp champion for you i wouldn't be too glad ser i name my brother jaime lannister i'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father the kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here send a raven for him i'm happy to wait the trial will be today do i have a volunteer anyone anyone i think we can assume that no one is willing i'll stand for the dwarf more wine your grace what was i saying simpler time i don't know what happened between you and those yellowhaired shits it was it was you're too young to remember wasn't it simpler selmy it was your grace the enemy was right there in the open vicious as you like all but sending you a bloody invitation nothing like today it sounds exhilarating exhilarating yes not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw you ever fuck a riverlands girl once i think you think i think you'd remember i don't want to know this is what matters back in our day you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the seven kingdoms and the riverlands we used to call it "making the eight " those were some lucky girls you ever make the eight barristan i don't believe so your grace those were the days which days exactly the ones where half of westeros fought the other half and millions died or before that when the mad king slaughtered woman and babies i can't rule the kingdoms if the starks and the lannisters because the voices in his head told him they deserved it or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground easy boy you might be my brother but you're speaking to the king i suppose it was all rather heroic if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight more wine your grace they burned most everything in the riverlands our fields our granaries are at each other throats so enough our homes they took our woman then they took 'em again when they was done they butchered them as if they was animals they covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire brigands most likely they weren't thieves they didn't steal nothing they even left something behind your grace it the king hand you're addressing not the king the king is hunting as you command your grace fish the sigil of house tully isn't that your wife house tully my lord hand these man were they flying a sigil a banner none your hand the one who was leading them taller by a foot than any man i've ever met saw him cut the blacksmith in two saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword that sounds like someone we know the mountain with your leave you're describing ser gregor clegane why should ser gregor turn brigand the man is an anointed knight i've heard him called tywin lannister mad dog i'm sure you have as well can you think of any reason the lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife if the lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king protection it would be that would be almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital i will return to winterfell and set matters straight well i cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life but perhaps i can give you justice in the name of our king robert lord beric dondarrion you shall have the command assemble 100 man and ride to ser gregor keep as you command in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the first man lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm she did nothing i did not command who'd have thought she had it in her piss on that send a raven i want you to stay i charge you to bring the king justice to the false knight gregor clegane and all those who shared in his crimes i denounce him and attaint him i strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death my lord this this is a drastic action it would be better to wait for king robert return grand maester pycelle my lord send a raven to casterly rock i'm the king i get what i want inform tywin lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannerman he will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm a bold move my lord and admirable but is it wise to yank the lion tail tywin lannister is the richest man in all the seven kingdoms gold wins wars not soldiers then how come robert is king and not tywin lannister fight i never loved my brothers hold attack attack come on ser vardis attack stand and fight coward yes enough ser vardis finish him what are you doing get up get up get up get up raise your sword raise it get up man a sad thing for a man to admit but it true on your feet get up get up and fight ser vardis no have mercy is it over you don't fight with

anything anything at all it wouldn't have been clean she told me about all the horses that she liked the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry a northerner with a jaw like an anvil so i challenged him to a duel i mean why not i'd read all the stories the little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories in the end she wouldn't even let him kill me "he just a boy " she said "please don't hurt him " clean so he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by and off they went is she still married to him oh no he got himself killed before the wedding and she ended up with his brother an even more impressive speciman she loves him i'm afraid and why wouldn't she i mean who could compare to him he just so good do you know what i learned losing that duel i learned that i'll never win not that way you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you that their game their rules i'm not going to fight them i'm going to fuck them

him no man could have protected him from himself i wonder ser barristan pay their debts who gave the king this wine his squire from the king own skin his squire the lannister boy such a dutiful boy to make sure his grace did not lack refreshmant i do hope the poor lad does not blame himself his grace has had a change of heart concerning daenerys targaryen whatever arrangemants you made unmake them at once i'm afraid those birds have flown i didn't realise you placed such a high value on my brother life the girl is likely dead already the stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs according to the prophecy the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth the earth ends at the black salt sea no horse can cross the poison water the earth does not end at the sea there are many dirts beyond the sea the dirt where i was born not dirts lands he a lannister lands yes there are thousands of ships in the free cities wooden horses that fly across the sea let speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs it not a chair it a throne throne a chair for a king to sit upon or a queen he might be the lowest of the lannisters but he one of us a king does not need a chair to sit upon he only needs a horse can't you help me make him understand the dothraki do things in their own time for their own reasons have patience khaleesi we will go home i promise you my brother was a fool i know but he was the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms have i said something funny ser forgive me khaleesi but your ancestor aegon the conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right and every day that he remains a prisoner he had no right to them he seized them because he could and because he had dragons ah well having a few dragons makes things easier you don't believe it have you ever seen a dragon khaleesi i believe what my eyes and ears report as for the rest it was 300 years ago who knows what really happened now if you'll pardon me i'll seek out the merchant captain see if he has any letters for me i'll come with you no no don't trouble yourself the less our name commands respect enjoy the market i'll rejoin you soon enough psst jorah the andal the spider sends his greetings and his congratulations a royal pardon you can go home now sweet reds i have sweet reds from lys volantis and the arbor tyroshi pear brandy andalish sours i have them i

of the seven kingdoms princess rise i'd still like to taste that wine that dornish swill no that not an opinion it a fact not worthy of a princess i have a dry red from the arbor nectar of the gods let me give you a cask a a gift you honour me ser the honour the honour is all mine ahahahahah you know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return princess i hope to repay your kindness someday rakharo if another house can seize one of our own put down that cask is something wrong i have a thirst open it the wine is for the khaleesi it not for the likes of you open it pour it would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe do as he says as the princess commands sweet isn't it and hold him captive with impunity can you smell the fruit ser taste it my lord tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue you first me i'm afraid i am not worthy of the vintage besides it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares you will drink stop him come we are no longer a house to be feared you came to us as outlaws poachers rapers killers thieves you came alone in chains without friends or honour you came to us rich and you came to us poor some of you bear the names of proud houses others only bastard names or no names at all your mother dead it does not matter all that is in the past here on the wall

house tarly keep the old gods and all of her children no my lord i was named in the light of the seven as my father was and his father before him why would you forsake the gods of your father and your house the night watch is my house now the seven have never answered my prayers perhaps the old gods will as you wish lad you've all been assigned an order according to our needs brave man terrible judgmant all of us dead all of us rotting in the ground and your strengths halder to the builders pyp to the stewards toad to the builders grenn to the rangers samwell to the stewards matthar to the

fetch hot water for his bath certainly and keep a fire burning in his chambers change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the lord commander requires of you not your personal glory not your honour do you take me for a servant we took you for a man of the night watch but perhaps we were wrong in that may i go as you wish jon wait don't you see what they're doing i see ser alliser revenge that all he wanted it and he got it stewards are nothing but maids i'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you it not fair fair but family i was singing for a high lord at acorn hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock i pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver so now i'm here at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old man and little shits like you i'll never see my family again i'll never be inside a woman again so don't tell me about fair i thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister think i was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock do you understand could you sing me a song pyp i'd like to hear a song now listen to me the old man is the lord commander of the night watch you'll be with him day and night yes you'll clean his clothes but you'll also take his letters attend him at meetings squire for him in battle you'll know everything be part of everything and he asked for you himself he wants to groom you for command hmm i just i always wanted to be a ranger i always wanted to be a wizard what no i'm serious so you'll stay and say your words with me lord stark a momant alone if you will he named you protector of the realm he did you're blessed with abilities that few man possess she won't care give me an hour and i can put a hundred swords at your command and what should i do with a hundred swords strike tonight while the castle sleeps we must get joffrey away from his mother and into our custody protector of the realm or no he who holds the king holds the kingdom every momant you delay gives cersei another momant to prepare by the time robert dies it will be too late for the both of us what about stannis saving the seven kingdoms from cersei and delivering them to stannis you're blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms you have odd notions about protecting the realm stannis is your older brother this isn't about the bloody line of succession that didn't matter when you rebelled against the mad king it shouldn't matter now what best for the kingdoms what best for the people we rule we all know what stannis is he inspires no love or loyalty he not a king i am and you're still blessed with youth stannis is a commander he led man into war twice he destroyed the greyjoy fleet yes he a good soldier everyone knows that so was robert tell me something do you still believe good soldiers make good kings i will not dishonour robert last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds you will sail to dragonstone tonight you will place this in the hand of stannis baratheon attacking him was stupid and what have you done with these blessings huh not his steward not his captain of the guard and not his wife only stannis himself yes my lord now leave us my lord protector the king has no trueborn sons joffrey and tomman are jaime lannister bastards you've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings so when the king dies the throne passes to his brother lord stannis so it would seem unless there is no "unless" he is the rightful heir nothing can change that and he cannot take the throne without your help you would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure joffrey succeeds do you have a shred of honour you are now hand of the king and protector of the realm all of the power is yours you need only one a madman the other a drunk reach out and take it make peace with the lannisters release the imp wed your daughter to joffrey we've plenty of time to get rid of stannis and if joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne we simply reveal his little secret and seat lord renly there instead we you'll need someone to share these burdens i assure you my price would be modest what you suggest is treason the future of our family will be determined in these next few months only if we lose make peace with the lannisters you say with the people who tried to murder my boy we only make peace with our enemies my lord that why it called "making peace" no i won't do it so it will be stannis and war there is no other choice he is the heir so why did you call me here we could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years not for my wisdom clearly you promised catelyn you would help me the queen has a dozen knights and a hundred manatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard i need the gold cloaks the city watch is 2 000 strong and sworn to defend the king peace look at you you know what you want me to do you know it has to be done or we could collapse into nothing as the targaryens did but it not honourable so the words stick in your throat when the queen proclaims one king and the hand proclaims another whose peace do the gold cloaks protect who do they follow the man who pays them hear my words and bear witness to my vow night gathers and now my watch begins it shall not end until my death i need you to become the man you were always meant to be i shall take no wife hold no lands father no children i shall wear no crowns and win no glory i shall live and die at my post i am the sword in the darkness i am the watcher on the walls i am the shield that guards the realms of man i pledge my life and honour to the night watch for this night and all the nights to come you knelt as boys not next year not tomorrow rise now as man of the night watch well done well done what he got there to me ghost bring it here gods be good what will they do to him when the khalasar rides he'll be leashed to a saddle and forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can and when he falls i saw a man last nine miles once now king robert still wants me dead this poisoner was the first he won't be the last i thought he'd leave me alone now that my brother is gone he will never leave you alone if you ride to darkest asshai his assassins will follow you if you sailed all the way to the basilisk isles his spies would tell him he will never abandon the hunt you're a targaryen the last targaryen your son will have targaryen blood you're in pain with 40 000 riders behind him he will not have my son he will not have you either khaleesi moon of my life are you hurt jorah the andal i heard what you did choose any horse you wish it is yours i make this gift to you and to my son the stallion who will mount the world lannisters i've had worse my lady i will also pledge a gift i will give him the iron chair that his mother father sat upon i will give him seven kingdoms i drogo will do this i will take my khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before i will kill the man in iron suits and tear down their stone houses perhaps it time to go home i will rape their woman take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to vaes dothrak this i vow i drogo son of bharbo i swear before the mother of mountains as the stars look down in witness as the stars look down in witness lord stark stop no all right the south doesn't seem to agree with you it all right let him through lord stark king joffrey and the queen regent request your presence in the throne room king joffrey king robert is gone the gods give him rest all is accomplished the city watch is yours good is lord renly joining us i fear lord renly has left the city he rode through the old gate an hour before dawn i know the truth jon arryn died for with ser loras tyrell and some 50 retainers last seen galloping south in some haste we stand behind you lord stark all hail his grace joffrey of houses baratheon and lannister the first of his name king of the andals and the first man lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm i command the council to make all necessary arrangemants for my coronation do you lord stark i wish to be crowned within the fortnight today i shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors ser barristan i believe no man here could ever question your honour king robert seal unbroken "lord eddard stark is herein named "protector of the realm "to rule as regent "until the heir come of age " is that why you called me here to pose me riddles may i see that letter ser barristan protector of the realm is this meant to be your shield lord stark a piece of paper those were the king words we have a new king now lord eddard when we last spoke you offered me some counsel allow me to return the courtesy bend the knee my lord bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days has he done this before in the grey waste you call home your son has no claim to the throne liar you condemn yourself with your own mouth lord stark ser barristan seize this traitor ser barristan is a good man a loyal man do him no harm you think he stands alone kill him kill all of them i command it commander take the queen and her children into custody escort them back to the royal apartmants and keep them there under guard jaime would have killed him my brother is worth a thousand of your friend man of the watch i want no bloodshed tell your man to lay down their swords no one needs to die now i did warn you not to trust me your brother or your lover don't act like fools the targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure jaime and i are more than brother and sister we shared a womb we came into this world together we belong together my son saw you with him do you love your children with all my heart no more than i love mine and they're all jaime thank the gods in the rare event that robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed are you going to say something clever i finish him off in other ways in the morning he doesn't remember you've always hated him hated him i worshipped him every girl in the seven kingdoms dreamed of him but he was mine by oath and when i finally saw him on our wedding day in the sept of baelor lean and fierce and blackbearded it was the happiest momant of my life that night he crawled on top of me stinking of wine and did what he did what little he could do and whispered in my ear "lyanna " 0 game of thrones s01e08 the pointy end srt yah left high left low go back to your room we should burn them snow not wrong my

until the end of time in the place of the traitor eddard stark why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch it is the wish of his grace that tywin lannister lord of casterly rock and warden of the west be

father crime no my lords i know he must be punished all i ask is mercy i know my lord father must regret what he did he was king robert friend and he loved him you all know he loved him he never wanted to be hand until the king asked him they must have lied to him lord renly or lord stannis or somebody even my little birds cannot find her they must have lied he said i wasn't the king why did he say that he was badly hurt maester pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy he wasn't himself otherwise he never would have said it a child faith such sweet innocence and yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes treason is treason anything else and sansa still engaged to joffrey if you still have any affection in your heart for me please do me this kindness your grace your sweet words have moved me but your father has to confess he has to confess and say that i'm the king or there'll be no mercy for him he will cersei will keep her close the rest of your household though all dead it grieves me to say i do so hate the sight of blood you watched my man being slaughtered and did nothing she with her dancing master she with him every morning and would again my lord i was unarmed unarmoured and surrounded by lannister swords when you look at me do you see a hero what madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about joffrey birth the madness of mercy that she might save her children ah the children it always the innocents who suffer it wasn't the wine that killed robert nor the boar the wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open she always comes back with scrapes and bruises she so clumsy but it was your mercy that killed the king i trust you know you're a dead man lord eddard the queen can't kill me cat holds her brother the wrong brother sadly and lost to her your wife has let the imp slip through her fingers if that true then slit my throat and be done with it not today my lord tell me something varys who do you truly serve hush the realm my lord someone must it othor without a doubt the other one is jafer flowers my lord less the hand the wolf tore off any sign of benjen or the rest of his party just these two my lord been dead awhile i'd say mmm the smell what smell there is none if they'd been dead for a long time wouldn't there be rot 0 game of thrones s01e09 baelor srt you've seen better days my lord i've given up trying to guess oh you too you see that fifteen she is a little flower and her honey all mine i'm sure she will give you many sons huh your father didn't come to the wedding he is quite ill my lord huh didn't come to the last one either or the one before that when i was still a boy your family has always pissed on me my lord i don't deny it you know it true the fine lord tully would never marry any of his children to mine i'm sure there were reasons i didn't need reasons i needed to get rid of sons and daughters you see how they pile up why are you here to ask you to open your gates my lord so my son and his bannerman may cross the trident and be on their way why should i let him if you could climb your own battlemants before they cut my balls off with a hot knife you would see that he has 20 000 man outside your walls they'll be 20 000 corpses when tywin lannister gets here don't try and frighten me lady stark your husband in a cell beneath the red keep and your son got no fur to keep his balls warm you swore an oath to my father oh yes i said some words and i swore oaths to the crown too if i remember right joffrey king now which makes your boy and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels it seems to me i travelled with a group of actors through the free cities if i had the sense the gods gave a fish i'd hand you both over to the lannisters why don't you stark tully lannister baratheon give me one good reason why i should waste a single thought on any of you and engage when does aemon think you'll be able to use that hand soon he says good you'll be ready for this then i thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so i had a new pommel made it called longclaw works as well for a wolf as a bear i think they taught me that each man has a role to play this is valyrian steel it was my father sword his father before him the mormonts have carried it for five centuries it was meant for my son jorah he brought dishonour to our house but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from westeros my lord you honour me but i can't oh you can and you will i wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast a bloody dead man tried to kill me the same is true at court so you'll take it i'll hear no more about it is that understood yes my lord right now don't think this means i approve of this nonsense with you and alliser thorne that a man sword it'll take a man to wield it i'll apologise to ser alliser tonight no you won't i sent him to king landing yesterday the hand that your wolf tore off that thing wrist i've uh ordered thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king i am the master of whisperers that should get young joffrey attention and it uh puts a thousand leagues between you and thorne now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper yes my lord well done well done you earned that snow well done go on let have a look at what the sword show us the sword my role is to be sly obsequious and without scruples sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword let have a look piss off come on i want to have a look at it in the light give it here what is it i look at its eyes give it i can't you can't what i i'm a good actor my lord i'm really not supposed to say and yet you really want to say you want to say that there was a raven i read the message to maester aemon it your brother robb what what about him he heading south to war huh can you free me from this pit all his bannerman have rallied to his side they'll keep him safe i should be there i should be with him if we do that they'll never get back across well what did he say lord walder has granted your crossing his man are yours as well huh less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you what does he want in return another visit i could you will be taking on his son olyvar as your personal squire he expects a knighthood in good time fine fine and and arya will marry his son waldron when they both come of age she won't be happy about that hm and and when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters but will i whichever you prefer he has a number he thinks will be suitable i see did you get a look at his daughters i did and one was do you consent can i refuse not if you want to cross then i consent no sam said you wanted to see me i did indeed perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me tell me did you ever wonder why the man of the night watch take no wives and father no children no so they will not love love is the death of duty if the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honour on the one hand as i said i'm no hero and those he loves on the other what would he do he he would do whatever was right no matter what then lord stark is one man in 10 000 most of us are not so strong what is honour compared to a woman love and what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or a brother smile what do you want tell me sam told you we're all human oh we all do our duty when there no cost to it honour comes easy then yet sooner or later in every man life there comes a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose and this is my day no riddles no stories tell me what do you want is that what you're saying oh it hurts boy oh yes i know you do not know no one knows i may be a bastard but he is my father and robb is my brother the gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows they waited till i was old what could i do when the ravens brought the news from the south the ruin of my house the death of my family peace i was helpless blind frail but when i heard they had killed my brother son and his poor son and the children even the little children who are you my father was maekar the first of his name did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northman loyal lad my brother aegon reigned after him when i had refused the throne and he was followed by his son aerys whom they called the mad king you're aemon targaryen i'm a maester of the citadel bound in service to castle black and the night watch i will not tell you to stay or go you must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days fighting for his father freedom as i have my lord my sun and stars drogo my horse blood of my blood no i must ride he fell from his horse a khal who cannot ride is no khal he tired that all he needs to rest robb we've ridden far enough today we'll camp here this is no place to camp a woman does not give us orders not even a khaleesi we'll camp here tell them khal drogo commanded it you do not command me khaleesi find mirri maz duur bring her to me the witch i'll bring you her head khaleesi bring her to me unharmed or khal drogo will hear why you denied me hyah hyah our scouts tell us the stark host has moved south from the twins it seems you're my last friend he just a boy with lord frey levies in tow they're a day march north the boy may lack experience and sense but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage ah oh do continue didn't mean to interrupt i do hope your savages are going to be of some use otherwise we've wasted good steel on them the great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes heavy black steel doublesided boys have been conquerors before shagga likes axes when the battle commances you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard the vanguard mmhm me and the tribesman on the front lines they do seem rather ferocious ferocious last night a moon brother stabbed a stone crow over a sausage three stone crows seized the moon brother and opened his throat bronn managed to keep shagga from chopping off the dead man cock which was fortunate but even still ulf is demanding blood money but the man giving cersei sleepless nights is the king the late king brother which shagga and gunthor refuse to pay when soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their commander surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimantal to the war effort there'll be no more discussion on the matter it appears i'm not hungry after all excuse me my lords where did you find one so pretty at this hour i took her took her from whom from uh ser what his name lord stannis has the best claim to the throne i don't know ginger cunt three tents down and he didn't have anything to say about it he said something well the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically we'll be at the vanguard tomorrow oh well i uh think i'll go and find myself one who are you who would you like me to be what did your mother call you shae what did your mother call you he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy my mother died giving birth to me is that

cersei knows you as a man of honour let do something i'm good at what are you good at i happen to be a great judge of character this sounds like a boring game it not here how it works i make a statemant about your past if i'm right you drink if i'm wrong i drink and no lying i'll know if you're lying i don't want to play this game fine bronn first your father beat you but my mother hit harder if you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave you killed your first man before you were 12 it was a woman she swung an axe at me you've been north of the wall what brought you up there work and you once loved a woman many years ago but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again oh wait that me your turn my mysterious foreign beauty i believe she will allow you to take the black i don't want to play it fun look at the fun we're having your mother was a whore drink all right your father left the family when you were very young never to return drink and we've established the rules about lying drink mm you wanted a different life and live out your days on the wall with your brother and your bastard son you came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere the whole shitstained world could drink off that one so specifics you wanted to be elsewhere but how would you get there i don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you so what a lowborn girl to do drink are you sure drink and don't talk about my mother and father ever or i will carve your eyes from your head you think my life is some precious thing to me my dear lady if i have offended you i apologise my turn fine fine ask away try to penetrate the enigma that is me who were you in love with that not how the game works i don't care the way the game works our lord here used to be married married how did you hear that you hear lots of things playing dice with lannister soldiers sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life that i would trade my honour for a few more years of another night perhaps not another night this night it not a pleasant story oh maybe i will cry i'm guessing the lady and i can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship so i was 16 my brother jaime and i were riding when we heard a scream she ran out onto the road clothes half torn off with two man on her heels jaime scared away the man easily enough while i wrapped her in my cloak she was too scared to send off on her own of what so while jaime hunted down the rapers i took her to the nearest inn and fed her her name was tysha she was a wheelwright orphan and she was hungry together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine impossible as it seems there was a time when i was unaccustomed to wine i forgot how afraid i was around girls how i was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother you grew up with actors i forgot about everything but tysha and somehow i found myself in her bed for three chickens i should hope so it didn't last long i didn't know what the hell i was doing but she was good to me she kissed me afterwards and sang me a song and by morning i was deep enough in love to ask for her hand a few lies a few gold coins one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife you learned their craft and you learnt it well for a fortnight anyway until the septon sobered up and told my father well i imagine that was the end of all that not quite first my father had jaime tell me the truth the girl was a whore you see jaime had arranged the whole thing the road the rapers all of it he thought it was time i had a woman after my brother confessed my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards but i grew up with soldiers he paid her well a silver for each man how many whores command that kind of price he brought me into the barracks and made me watch by the end she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor i would have killed the man who did that to me you should have known she was a whore really i was 16 drunk and in love a girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later i learned how to die a long time ago as i said i was young and stupid you are still young and stupid hyah what is it what do you want you're sleeping through

ourselves behind stannis my lords here is what i say to these two kings renly baratheon is nothing to me you're afraid just like hodor i'm not afraid of some hole in the ground nor stannis neither why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the south what do they know of the wall or the wolfswood even their gods are wrong why shouldn't we rule ourselves again it was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead there sits the only king i mean to bend my knee to the king in the north i'll have peace on those terms you've lived beyond the wall what are you scared of they can keep their red castle and their iron chair too the king in the north am i your brother now and always now and always my sword is yours in victory and defeat from this day until my last day the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north i'm a crippled boy and i'm willing to go the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north lady stark i want to see him now leave us you look lovely tonight lady stark that my grandfather lord rickard widowhood becomes you your bed must be lonely is that why you came i'm not at my best but i think i could be of service you slip out of that gown and we'll see if i'm up to it oh i do like a violent woman i will kill you tonight ser pack your head in a box and send it to your sister let me show you how hit me again over the ear he was burned alive by the mad king aerys and again and again you're stronger than you look it shouldn't take long that is what you want the world to believe isn't it that you don't fear death but i don't my lady the dark is coming for all of us why cry about it because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just what gods are those the trees your husband prayed to where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off if your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice that lyanna my father sister because of man like you there are no man like me only me my son bran how did he come to fall from that tower i pushed him out the window why i hoped the fall would kill him why you should get some sleep do you remember me now boy eh king robert was supposed to marry her it going to be a long war i can't believe we're actually at war was it this exciting last time when you were young what does it say have we captured robb stark yet what our next move stop talking get back into bed they have my son the stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped i've heard his wolf killed a dozen man and as many horses but rhaegar targaryen kidnapped her is it true about stannis and renly both baratheon brothers have taken up against us jaime captured his armies scattered it a catastrophe perhaps we should sue for peace there your peace joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove ned stark head you'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing robb stark to the table now he winning robert started a war to win her back in case you hadn't noticed i'm told we still have his sisters the first order of business is ransoming ser jaime no truces we can't afford to look weak we should march on them at once first we must return to casterly rock to raise they have my son get out all of you not you you were right about eddard stark if he were alive we could have used him to broker a peace with winterfell and riverrun which would have given us more time to deal with robert brothers but now he killed rhaegar but she died anyway madness madness and stupidity i always thought you were a stunted fool perhaps i was wrong half wrong i'm new to strategy but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies it appears we can't stay here no one will stay here ser gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the riverland on fire from god eye to the red fork the rest of us will regroup at harrenhal that where i saw father and you will go to king landing and do what rule you will serve as hand of the king in my stead you will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too if needs be and if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest baelish varys pycelle heads spikes walls why not my uncle why not anyone why me you're my son oh one more thing you see he not here you will not take that whore to court do you understand ser jorah gently gently my son where is he i want him where is he the boy did not live tell me what is there to tell how did my son die here shaggydog rickon he never lived my princess the woman say what do the woman say they say the child was monstrous twisted i pulled him out myself he was scaled like a lizard blind with leather wings like the wings of a bat when i touched him the skin fell from his bones inside he was full of graveworms i warned you that only death can pay for life that beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels you knew the price where is khal drogo show him to me show me what i bought with my son life as you command lady come i will take you to him time enough for that later i want to see him now the khalasar is gone a khal who cannot ride is no khal the dothraki follow only the strong he doesn't like chains what are you doing down here i'm sorry my princess drogo my sun and stars why is he out here alone he seems to like the warmth princess he lives you asked for life you paid for life this is not life when will he be as he was when the sun rises in the west sets in the east when the seas go dry when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves come back up with us no i came to see father leave us i don't want you alone with this sorceress i have nothing more to fear from this woman go you knew what i was buying and you knew the price it was wrong of them to burn my temple it angered the great shepherd this is not god work my child was innocent innocent he would have been the stallion who mounts the world now he will burn no cities now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust remember me there a bright boy how many times have i told you he in king landing with sansa and arya i spoke for you i saved you saved me three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me girl i saw my god house burn there where i had healed man and woman beyond counting in the streets i saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread the head of a young boy that i had cured of fever just three moons past so tell me again exactly what it was that you saved your life he was down here i saw him why don't you take a look at your khal then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone you can't get out of my way sam they'll put out the word they'll send out ravens people will come after you do you know what happens to deserters better than you do what are you going to do saw him when i'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through king joffrey throat you can't leave us now we need you here move i won't let you go move no hyah hand of the king so it would seem and your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to king landing no he said i couldn't take you with me to king landing last night when i was sleeping he was very specific on that point he knew my name what he said "don't bring shae with you to king landing" i believe he used the word "whore" are you ashamed of me are you afraid that i'm dancing around the court with my tits out i'm funny now i'm shae the funny whore my father probably the most powerful man in the country certainly the richest here shaggydog he has all seven kingdoms in his pockets everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says he always been a cunt i believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you why don't you come with me be the hand lady because the king needs a hand and the hand i know what a hand needs ghost hyah you both miss him hyah hyah hyah samwell is he dead no he not dead did we get him come on help me get him up lucky you've got plenty of padding we're taking you back to where you belong i belong with my brother but we're your brothers now they'll kill you if they find out you've gone it only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams they'll kill you if they know you came after me go back sam told us everything we're sorry about your father but it doesn't matter you took the oath you can't leave i have to you can't you said the words i don't care about "hear my words and bear witness to my vow " to hell with all of you "night gathers and now my watch begins "it shall not end until my death "i shall live and die at my post " but that doesn't mean that "i am the sword in the darkness " "the watcher on the walls " "the shield that guards the realms of man "i pledge my life and honour to the night watch "for this night and all nights to come " do you remember our first ride my sun and stars if you are in there if you haven't gone away show me you're a fighter you've always been a fighter i need you to fight now i know you're very far away bran but come back to me my sun and stars when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east then you shall return to me my sun and stars kings oh i can tell you all there is to know about kings the thing you need to understand about kings is for the past 67 years i've known truly known more kings than any man alive my lady my lady they're complicated man but i know how to serve them yes and keep on serving them aerys targaryen of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us madness is the worst he was a good man such a charmer to watch him melt away before my eyes consumed by dreams of fire and blood you'll be coming with me boy and you'll be keeping your mouth shut my lady robert baratheon was an entirely different animal powerful man great warrior but alas winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things they say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down he can often be blind to the enemies at his side now i serve his son king joffrey may the gods bless his reign my lady he is a capable young man strong military mind stern but sternness in defence of the realm is no vice it far too soon to know what manner of king he will be but i sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king mmm true greatness so what the thing what thing about kings my lady my lady you said "the thing you need to understand about kings " what things what when you started you never mind let me see you out my dear it all right no need yes yes till the next time right when you imagine yourself up there how do you look does the crown fit do all the lords and ladies simper and bow my lady the ones who sneered at you for years it hard for them to simper and bow without heads a man with great ambition and no morals i wouldn't bet against you and what would you do my friend if you found yourself sitting up there i must be one of the few man in this city who doesn't want to be king you must be one of the few man in the city who isn't a man oh you can do better than that when they castrated you did they take the pillar with the stones i've always wondered have you robb do you spend a lot of time wondering what between my legs i picture a gash like a woman is that about right i am flattered of course to be pictured at all must be strange for you even after all these years a man from another land despised by most feared by all am i that is good to know do you lie awake at night fearing my gash but you carry on robb whispering in one king ear and then the next i admire you and i admire you lord baelish a grasper from a minor house with a major talent for befriending powerful man and woman a useful talent i'm sure you'd agree so here we stand in mutual admiration and respect playing our roles serving a new king robb long may he reign my king my king my lords shall we begin you're arry now hear me arry the orphan boy no one asks an orphan too many questions cos nobody gives three shits what your name arry you've a long way to travel and in bad company i've 20 this time man and boys all bound for the wall you've ruined your sword your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons and i didn't find no little lordlings down
