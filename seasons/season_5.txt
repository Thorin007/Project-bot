this pyramid you're boring so i could watch the city below decline into chaos what was the name of the man you lost white rat your grace i want him buried with honor publically in the temple of the graces the sons of the harpy will hear that message make them very angry angry snakes lash out makes chopping off their heads that much easier find the man who did this and bring them to me you don't

winterfell you know who rules at winterfell now roose bolton mmm the traitor who plunged a dagger in robb stark heart don't you want to avenge him i want a great many things your grace but i'm a sworn brother of the night watch now i've been talking to your sworn brothers many of them love you they're good man <i>many don't </i> tell me my future or i'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head you were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the wall <i>why</i> it where she belonged some of the night watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings they were born on the wrong side of the wall that doesn't make them monsters no matter i shall take back the north from the thieves who stole it your blood tywin lannister is dead he can't protect them now i shall mount roose bolton head on a spike but if i'm to take winterfell i need more man the man of the night watch are sworn to play no part i'm not talking about the damn night watch i'm talking about the wildlings your grace you want the wildlings to march in your army if they swear to follow me i'll pardon them we'll take winterfell once the north is won give me a taste i'll declare them citizens of the realm i'll give them land to live on it a fair offer more than fair i'll offer them their lives and their freedom if mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty i don't think that likely you admire him don't you i respect him he likes you convince him to bend the knee your grace or he burns three questions you get how much time do i have nightfall the sun drops fast this time of year <i>hurry jon snow </i> <i>shield up </i> <i> attack my lord</i> attack don't cross your feet my sons had swords in their hands from the time they could walk this one you won't like the answers <i>lord arryn will never be a great warrior </i> <i>great warrior</i> he swings a sword like a girl with palsy my lord <i>sword up my lord</i> some boys develop more slowly he still young he 13 boys go to war at 13 he has other gifts does he the gift of a great name i've been promised to the prince sometimes that all one needs goodbye lord royce and thank you for all you've done for me i have done nothing more than my duty my lady i have no doubt that on my return robin skills will have improved immeasurably he'll be safe here <i>as for his skills </i> i make no promises will we head north at some point he said sansa had a brother at castle black when will we marry we're a few days' ride from the kingsroad but that will take us us the only reason you're here is because jaime lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital you're hundreds of miles from king landing no one knows what you look like no one cares you're safe but i'm your squire do you even know what a squire is an attendant to a knight i'm not a knight you will never wed the prince that means you're not a squire well where would i go i don't care i'm not your mother you swore to find the stark girls i found arya she didn't want my protection <i> sansa still might </i> will you shut your mouth i didn't ask for your advice i don't want anyone following me i'm not a leader all i ever wanted was to fight for a lord i believed in you will wed the king the good lords are dead and the rest are monsters you told lord royce we were going to the fingers i did but we're heading west we are if he wanted to betray us he already would have lord royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is but he not alone in that castle do you trust all those knights and ladies <i>stable boys and serving girls</i> no do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us but if he finds out but i will be queen no but i pay them well and they've seen what happens to man who disappoint me so where are we going to a land where you trust everyone to a land so far from here even cersei lannister can't get her hands on you it was such a deep deep shock to us all your father was a a force to be reckoned with oh yes he truly was i wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such but <i>but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear</i> just how formidable a person you were dealing with what a what a force to be reckoned with thank you so much for your kind words deepest condolences your grace this tragedy i never trusted varys i often warned you'll be queen your grace cousin lancel i hardly recognized you my deepest sympathies i apologize for my son appearance uncle it quite all right they call themselves sparrows bloody fanatics religion has its place of course but at a certain point they never would have come to the capital when tywin was alive for a time i'm sure he'll grow out of it whatever it is excuse me of course your wounds from the blackwater seem to have healed it wasn't my wounds that needed healing what can i do for you you can forgive me what could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness i led you into the darkness i doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere then comes another i tempted you into our unnatural relations and of course there was the king his boar hunt his wine i don't know what you're talking about i'm a different person now i've found peace in the light of the seven <i>you can too </i> <i>they watch over all of us </i> younger ready to dole out mercy or justice their world is at hand i will pray for your father soul the day tywin lannister soul needs your help it looks like dorne it doesn't it does that the that the sunspear bit right there and that where the mountains are and over here is <i>more beautiful </i> is sunsnake stonespear sandstone yes yes sandstone just there fine it dorne we should go there i think we would have a lovely time <i>to cast you down and take all you hold dear </i> judging by my experience that would be wonderful dorne highgarden anywhere but here we're late for dinner as it is you're very respectful i'm very hungry what your name olyvar my lady i'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting olyvar wwill the king and i have children my lady perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet why they all know about me anyway everybody knows everything about everyone what the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this in any event you shouldn't keep your intended waiting my intended please <i>tywin dead </i> <i>that means no one can force cersei to marry me </i> no the king will have 20 children and you will have three lucky you unlucky you you think i want that woman married to my brother if she doesn't marry me she doesn't go to highgarden which means she stays in king landing <i>which means you're trapped here with cersei lannister as your mother by law </i> perhaps perhaps perhaps eunuch the spider the master of whisperers imp halfman you don't need to be afraid of my father that doesn't make sense there are faster ways to kill yourself not for a coward you are many things my friend but not a coward you never told me why you set me free your brother asked me to could have said no refuse the kingslayer a dangerous proposition not as dangerous as releasing me you risked your life your position everything gold will be their crowns why you're not family you owe me nothing i didn't do it for you i did it for the seven kingdoms a drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the seven kingdoms i don't believe in saviors i believe man of talent have a part to play in the war to come you're going to have to find another soldier i'm done with westeros and westeros is done with me you have many admirable qualities selfpity is not one of them gold their shrouds any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power but earning it for yourself that takes work i'm not wellsuited for work i think you are you have your father instincts for politics and you have compassion compassion yes i killed my lover with my bare hands i shot my own father with a crossbow come on we have to go i never said you were perfect what is it you want exactly peace prosperity a land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine the powerful have always preyed on the powerless that how they became powerful in the first place perhaps we have to go cersei and perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there no other way <i>if you sat on the iron throne </i> <i>would you spread misery throughout the land</i> i will never sit on the iron throne <i>no you won't </i> <i>but you could help another climb those steps</i> and take that seat the seven kingdoms need someone stronger than tomman but gentler than stannis <i>bearers put it down </i> a monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people a ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name good luck finding him who said anything about "him" you have a choice my friend you can stay here at illyrio palace and drink yourself to death or you can ride with me to meereen meet daenerys targaryen <i>bearers up </i> and decide if the world is worth fighting for can i drink myself to death on the road to meereen when did the unsullied start patrolling the streets of meereen looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves our mission to yunkai was a resounding success the wise masters of yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed man and the former slaveholders all matters of consequence will be brought to you for review good <i>away </i> they did ask for some concessions concessions politics is the art of compromise your grace i'm not a politician i'm a queen <i>forgive me you're right of course </i> still it easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones i don't expect the wise masters to be happy slavery made them rich i ended slavery they do not ask for the return of slavery they ask for the reopening of the fighting pits <i>your grace we are honored by your presence </i> the fighting pits where slaves fought slaves to the death in the new world that you've brought to us free man would fight free man <i>the pit fighters you liberated</i> <i>plead for this opportunity </i> bring some here and ask them yourself no fighting pits opening them would show the people of yunkai and meereen that you respect their traditions <i>the mourners are waiting </i> i do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting if you how many times must i say no before you understand whatever he wants from me he not going to get it if he really believes i'm going to reopen the fighting pits you should reopen the fighting pits what my mother was a whore i told you that she liked to drink pear brandy the older she got the less she made selling her body the more she wanted to drink are you sure they will keep waiting so one day when i was 12 she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before i'm sorry why i was a bad child i wasn't big but i was quick and i loved to fight so they sold me to a man in tolos who trained fighters for the pits i had my first match when i was 16 you were sold into slavery i want a momant alone with him forced to fight to the death for the amusemant of the masters and you're defending the fighting pits i'm only here because of those pits i learned to fight like a dothraki screamer a norvoshi priest a westerosi knight soon i was famous 10 000 man and woman screamed my name when i stepped into the pit i made so much money for my master he set me free when he died but your grace many of these lords and ladies have travelled i joined the second sons and then i met you you're the queen everyone too afraid of you to speak truth everyone but me you've made thousands of enemies all across the world as soon as they see weakness they'll attack show your strength here now that why i have the unsullied patrolling the streets day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of unsullied you're not the mother of unsullied you're the mother of dragons i don't want another child bones dropped at my feet no one seen drogon in weeks for all i know he flown halfway across the world i can't control them anymore a dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen viserion they will wait rhaegal easy easy easy so here we are here we are when we first met you were my prisoner and now for our last meeting this doesn't have to be our last meeting no but it will be you know what stannis wants he never wanted you to be a kingsguard he wants me to bend the knee and he wants the free folk to fight for him i'll give him this much he bold shouldn't a king be bold <i>oh aye </i> i respect him if he gets what he wants i expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the iron throne the last hundred years but here you are protecting his dead body but i'll never serve him you told me you weren't here to conquer you told me your people have bled enough that right i don't want them bleeding for stannis baratheon either you spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history thenns and hornfoots the iceriver clans even the giants a life work uniting them you didn't do it for power what he built it ours you didn't do it for glory you brought them together to save them <i>because none of them will survive the winter </i> <i>not if they're north of the wall </i> isn't their survival more important than your pride pride fuck my pride this isn't about that then bend the knee and save your people they followed me because they respected me he built it for us he meant it for us because they believed in me the momant i kneel for a southern king that all gone and how many tens of thousands are out there right now how many woman how many children and you won't go out and rescue them because why you're afraid of looking afraid oh i am afraid no shame in that how will they do it beheading hanging they're going to try to take it away they'll burn you alive bad way to go i'll be honest with you i don't want to die and burnt to death i don't want people to remember me like that scorched and screaming but it better than betraying everything i believe and what happens to your people yes all of it they you preserve your dignity and die standing and they'll sing songs about you you'd rather burn than kneel the great hero until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there no one left to sing you're a good lad truly you are but if you can't understand why i won't enlist my people in a foreigner war all of them out there our enemies there no point explaining i think you're making a terrible mistake the freedom to make my own mistakes was all i ever wanted mance rayder you've been called the kingbeyondthewall westeros only has one king bend the knee i promise you mercy kneel and live this was my home for many years i wish you good fortune they're waiting in line to make sure he really dead in the wars to come we all must choose man or woman young or old lord or peasant our choices are the same we choose light or we choose darkness <i>we choose good or we choose evil </i> we choose the true god or the false free folk <i>there is only one true king</i> <i>and his name is stannis </i> and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes here stands your king of lies behold the fate of those who choose the darkness they'll set to work on tearing us apart they have nothing to do with it the man who murdered our father he tore us apart he the enemy i've been telling you for years you've been defending him for years this is exactly what they want we shouldn't go in of course we should and now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath did you set him free tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose you killed him by mistake with stupidity you're a man of action aren't you when it occurs to you to do something you do it never mind the consequences get out get out take a look look at the consequences here they are he loved you more than anyone in this world apologies i still don't see why i had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail i saved your life if they catch you they catch me i cannot say i feel overly guilty let go no about leaving you in that fucking crate do you know what it like to stuff your shit through one of those airholes no i only know what it like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard pentos the home of my colleague illyrio mopatis a merchant he and i met many years ago through mutual friends

certainly do it a fine place isn't it no one here by that name a fine place i never thought i'd end up settling down in a place like this you won't pardon we won't get to live at stokeworth when mother dies my sister gets the castle because she older oh she hates me she calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother not looking you know what i think please i think you're a good person and your sister is a mean person she is i've been all over the world and if there one thing i've learned it that meanness comes around people like your sister they always get what coming to them eventually one way or another who that i crossed the narrow sea i have nowhere else to go jaime fucking lannister ser jaime ser bronn of the blackwater i was very sorry to hear about your father thank you this is my betrothed lollys a pleasure run along love beautiful young bride you've chosen when were you planning on getting married just get on with it on with what you have everywhere else to go what you're here for there no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me it very good for you lollys will be marrying ser willis bracken mmm we made a deal your sister and i i would have advised against that how is this good for me 'cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important and when we return i'm going to give you a much better girl and a much better castle but wait return from where as far south as south goes <i>my future queen </i> the prince does not wish to be disturbed remove yourself from my path or i'll take that longaxe and i'll shove it <i>captain </i> <i>let her pass </i> your brother was murdered and you sit here in the water gardens cersei staring at the sky and doing nothing oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law that is not murder your brother you don't have to remind me he was my brother long before he was anything to you what will you do about his death i will bury him i will mourn for him and then you would have me go to war the whole country would have you go to war then we are lucky the whole country does not decide walder frey the sand snakes are with me they have the love of their people they will avenge their father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing oberyn is dead <i>and this lannister girl skips</i> <i>about the water gardens</i> eating our food breathing our air how many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill let me have her let me send her to cersei one finger at a time the mountain i loved my brother and you made him very happy for that you will always have a place in my heart but we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance not here not while i rule and how long will that be the unsullied are too conspicuous anyone can see you coming from a mile off of course you haven't found any sons of the harpy meryn trant you haven't have you my second sons on the other hand they drink they whore fight in the streets they blend in they overhear things in taverns follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys break a few fingers overhear a few more things before you know it in the old times whenever braavos stood in danger cersei no one here we go in a hurry you're afraid unsullied fear nothing right that your problem you understood fear once long ago but you've forgotten what it means someone who forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide walder frey fear is useful that way sons of the harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck on all of our necks please your grace you must kill him it would send a message i think you should exercise restraint your grace why for one thing he may have valuable information the son of the harpy has no more valuable information how do you know that because i questioned him the mountain and the information you did get he is young and poor he is born free why should he want to bring back slavery what did it do for him perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was they pay him great families afraid to do a thing they pay poor man to do it for them and how do you know this everyone know this i don't know it and i'm the head of a great family meryn trant <i>we do not know what this man did or didn't do </i> give him a trial at least a fair trial show all the citizens of meereen that you're better than those who would depose you teach them a better way i do not know the place from where old ser comes things maybe are different there i hope but here in meereen before daenerys stormborn they own us so we learn much about them <i>cersei walder frey </i> or we do not live long they teach me what they are mercy fair trial these mean nothing to them all they understand is blood <i>thank you all for your counsel </i> your grace a word please i beg you about what about your father about the mad king the mad king you're here to remind me of my enemies' lies consider me reminded the mountain your grace i served in his kingsguard i was at his side from the first your enemies did not lie go on when the people rose in revolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame he murdered sons in front of their fathers he burned man alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed <i>and his efforts</i> <i>to stamp out dissent</i> meryn trant led to rebellion that killed every targaryen except two i'm not my father no your grace thank the gods but the mad king gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the very end i will not have the son of the harpy executed without a fair trial your grace there a bug cersei yes best be careful you might accidently consume some solid food when i agreed to come with you did i misrepresent my intentions besides what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box you don't like it i want to take a walk <i>you can't </i> cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head <i>walder frey </i> she ought to offer her cunt best part of her for the best part of me well i suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere are we really going to spend the entire road to volantis talking about the futility of everything you're right no point <i>the road to volantis</i> you said we were going to meereen what in volantis the road to meereen and what do you hope to find at the end of the road to meereen <i>the mountain </i> i told you a ruler we've already got a ruler everywhere has already got a ruler every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone banner hanging from it you were quite good you know at ruling during your brief tenure as hand i didn't rule i was a servant still a man of talent managed to kill a lot of people the titan would step with fire in his eyes meryn trant yes but you showed great promise in other areas as well she wanted me to leave king landing she begged me i wouldn't go why 'cause i liked it power even as a servant people follow leaders and they will never follow us they find us repulsive cersei i find us repulsive and we find them repulsive which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away and yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box <i>not for long </i> you're right let go for a walk no walder frey how many dwarves are there in the world is cersei going to kill them all not him are you trying to deceive your queen shall i throw them in a cell your grace that won't be necessary ser meryn i don't want to dissuade the other hunters mistakes will be made thank you your grace thank you your grace thank you take the head pardon me your grace the mountain i would take it if you don't mind it could prove useful for my work very good over there will be fine you heard the man over there you're the hand of the king no uncle clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role i'm merely advising my son until he comes of age meryn trant and chooses a hand for himself your grace i would be willing to serve provisionally as the king hand until he becomes old enough you're a good man lord tyrell but i don't imagine you'll have the time in addition to being master of ships the king has appointed you master of coin oh your grace he called your experience and wisdom in ficial matters unparalleled must be good food if it crowded he said he would be honored to have you represent the crown interests in the same the honor is all mine your grace your grace in the past on several occasions a grand maester has served as the king hand the king has named qyburn the new master of whisperers your grace him this this man this embarrassmant to the citadel your grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post ale the qualification of loyalty grand maester that far more than the eunuch ever had far more than many ever have i must say i cannot see uncle kevan in light of your position as commander of the lannister armies it would please the king if you would serve as his master of war no man living better deserves the title that is kind of you to say i would like to hear it from the king himself ale the king is very busy at this momant he should be here learning what it means to rule he is learning on this occasion in his capacity as ruler he asked me to speak on his behalf i returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother and to you and to serve the king i did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet to watch you stack the small council with sycophants before we left a maester gave you a raven scroll sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be my brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission what mission that is not your concern as master of war i do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern you are the queen mother nothing more you would abandon your king in his time of need if he wants to send for me i will be waiting for him you are becoming an observant young lady at casterly rock <i>come on you know this one </i> <i>it looks like an animal </i> snake sssnake s it an s right very good huh did you know that the youngest lord commander in history osric stark was elected at the age of 10 i know s he'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies my mother used to say "dark wings dark words " you'll learn i promise i taught ser davos and old people are terrible at learning new things well you're a wonderful teacher very patient i only said that the more time that you spend practicing <i>the faster</i> <i>you'll be able to read </i> that all right we're doing just fine i'm sure you and "ostrich" stark have a lot to talk about how old were you when you learned how to read an old saying inaccurate in this case three three who taught you your mother no old maester cressen did i had a lot of time to practice my mother kept me inside because what do you call it in the

just a knight she dyed her hair but it her he a man of true nobility he was acting commander when the wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings hear hear he a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the watch and the wall almost all of his life <i>aye </i> he the only true choice ser denys mallister joined the watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than

<i>with other houses</i> and parlaying those alliances into greater power the best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man skin off the best way is marriage now that you're a bolton by royal decree it high time you married a suitable bride to serve well and as it happens i've found the perfect girl to solidify our hold on the north that moat cailin yes a bit shabby isn't it you've been here before on our way down to king landing with my father and arya where are you taking me home the boltons have winterfell a girl must become no one your marriage proposal it wasn't for you no

<i>banners</i> how do we get through there we don't we go around takes us miles out of the way we'll lose sight of them there is only one god doesn't matter i know where they're going aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire how did you end up squiring for the imp he hates that nickname well he not here to complain about it is he i squired for a knight named ser lorimer during the war of the five kings one night he had a bit too much to drink and he was famished so he borrowed a ham a girl knows his name he borrowed it he wasn't a thief he was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking <i>i was drunk too </i> he gave me half the ham next morning one of the guards saw him passed out <i>under a wagon with the hambone still in his hand </i> they hanged him that afternoon they tied the noose for me too <i>but lord tywin heard</i> <i>my family name was payne </i> and all man know his gift so he pardoned me and sent me to king landing to squire for his son as punishmant for both of you it didn't seem that way lord tyrion was always very good to me yes all your lords have been very kind to you all except me sorry you had to squire for such a nasty person i'm not sorry you're the best fighter i've ever seen you beat the hound where are they taking him i'm proud to be your squire i'm sorry i'm always snapping at you if you didn't snap at me i wouldn't learn anything you want to be a knight pod yes <i>starting tomorrow we'll train with a sword twice a day </i> before we ride in the morning and after you make camp in the evening and i'm going to show you how to ride properly thank you i can't knight you but i can teach you how to fight i suppose that more important queen margaery queen margaery you weren't a knight but you were a kingsguard to renly baratheon weren't you i was lord tyrion said he was a good man he was how did you end up serving renly when i was a girl my father held a ball i'm his only living child so he wanted to make a good match for me he invited dozens of young lords to tarth i didn't want to go but he dragged me to the ballroom <i>queen margaery</i> and it was wonderful none of the boys noticed how mulish and tall i was they shoved each other and threatened to duel when they thought it was their turn to dance they whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles my father smiled at me and i smiled at him i had never been so happy till i saw a few of the boys snickering and then they all started to laugh queen margaery they couldn't keep the game going any longer they were toying with me "brienne the beauty" they called me great joke and i realized i was the ugliest girl alive a great lumbering beast i tried to run away but renly baratheon took me in his arms "don't let them see your tears " he told me "they're nasty little shits valar dohaeris <i>queen margaery</i> and nasty little shits aren't worth crying over " he danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word renly was the king brother after all but wasn't he lord tyrion said he was yes pod he liked man i'm not an idiot he didn't love me he didn't want me he danced with me because he was kind and didn't want to see me hurt he saved me from being a joke <i> i am his and he is mine </i> <i> i am hers and she is mine </i> from that day until his last day and i couldn't save him in return nothing more hateful than failing to protect the one you love one day i will avenge king renly but you said a shadow murdered him how do you fight a shadow a shadow with the face of stannis baratheon i know it was stannis i know it in my heart stannis is a man not a shadow and a man can be killed <i>from this day until the end of my days </i> lord commander your grace i'd like to speak alone olly is my steward now as i was lord commander mormont i want him to attend my meetings to learn from man with experience one day he might command very well have you considered my offer i have and i thank you for it you do me great honor did i hurt you all my life i wanted to be jon stark say the word and you will be but i have to refuse you i'm lord commander of the night watch my place is here i'm giving you the chance to avenge your family to take back the castle where you grew up to rule the north i wish i could fight beside you believe me i do no you were lovely but i swore a sacred vow at the godswood i pledged my life to the night watch you're as stubborn as your father i can imagine no higher praise i didn't mean it as praise honor got your father killed but if your mind made up i won't try and dissuade you may i ask your grace how long you plan to stay at castle black are you bored of us already you saved us from mance rayder army it all happened so fast yes we will never forget that but it a question of survival <i>the night watch can't</i> <i>continue to feed your man</i> and the wildling prisoners indefinitely winter is coming i know it we march on winterfell within the fortnight before the snows trap us here and the wildlings if they'd rather burn than fight for me so be it i was scared maybe i hurt you i leave their fate to you you could execute them that the safest course or you could see if this tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than mance ever was i assume the brothers of the night watch would rather see the wildlings dead most of the brothers yes <i>there little love</i> <i>for the free folk here </i> you're the lord commander your decision you have many enemies in castle black it sounded like no no no have you considered sending alliser thorne elsewhere give him command of eastwatchbythesea i heard it was best to keep your enemies close whoever said that didn't have many enemies <i>he sees something in you </i> might not be apparent from his tone but it the truth he believes in you i'm sorry i disappointed him the king is a complicated man you're very sweet but he wants to do what right for the seven kingdoms as long as he ruling them he the one true king he has a blood right to that throne i've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the seven kingdoms have you now how does the night watch vow go again i'll bet you've got it memorized since you got here night gathers and now my watch begins no not that bit the bit at the end the sweetest king who ever lived i am the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the realms of man <i> i pledge my life</i> right that enough the shield that guards the realms of man that what you swore to be now i'm not a learned man but the best way to help the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world it just might mean wading in the muck i've been sweeping this floor for days this is all i want to do all day getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be done and what needs to be done as long as the boltons rule the north the north will suffer just one man opinion what do you want who are you what you who walk in here with a coin you never earned every day for the rest of my life whose value you do not respect who are you no one ow cunt a lie a sad little lie who are you i told you i'm no do that again and who are you you're about to find out what are you doing wouldn't that be glorious we were only playing the game of faces a girl is not ready clearly not i am ready for what for whatever you want to be a faceless man to be no

thank you father which of the seven will you worship today the maiden always the maiden about king tomman first of his name <i>and the stranger </i> two is extra you realize yes yes what are you doing this establishmant belongs to lord petyr baelish you can't you have profaned our faith the faith of our fathers and forefathers i am the high septon of the you are a sinner and you shall be punished king tomman ah sinner sinner sinner sinner <i> repent</i> sinner sinner sinner sinner <i> shame on you </i> sinner sinner your grace grand maester lord tyrell uh it doesn't matter asthe high septon pf the faith of the seven still sounds strange to me i give voice to the will of the gods and am their foremost servant in this world an insult to me is an insult to the gods an assault on my person is an assault on our very religion you were assaulted i was by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows <i>they humiliated me </i> <i>they beat me </i> <i>they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones </i> i am lucky to be alive does queen margaery sound strange to you i heard this assault began in littlefinger brothel high septon this is a rather shocking thing to hear <i> i tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us </i> even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the mother so you were ministering to the needs of these devout prostitutes a man private affairs ought to stay private what do you want from us high septon justice i ask that you protect our faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells <i>i ask that you execute</i> <i>their leader </i> so strange <i>this socalled</i> <i>high sparrow </i> he a threat to everything we hold sacred if he goes unpunished and where do i find this man this high sparrow i don't think this is a good idea your grace nonsense ser meryn these are deeply religious people where can i find the high sparrow <i>seven blessings </i> <i> thank you </i> <i> just a little more </i> <i>thank you </i> husband wife thank you a young man said i'd find the high sparrow back here where is he high sparrow sounds ridiculous doesn't it like lord duckling or king turtle still it meant to we're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us the notion that we're all equal in the eyes of the seven doesn't sit well with some so they belittle me sometimes it feels odd <i>seven blessings</i> to you my dear it only a name quite an easy burden to bear far easier than hers <i>why no shoes</i> because i gave them away to someone who needed them more we all do that it stops us from forgetting what we really are is that why you came to king landing to remind everyone i'm the king everyone hard enough job reminding myself well i tell them no one special and they think i'm special for telling them so perhaps they're right it would be comforting to believe that wouldn't it have the gods sent you here to tempt me i hope not i had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me for that incident with the high septon an unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative i've married the most beautiful woman in the world of the gods in this world wouldn't you say hypocrisy is a boil lancing a boil is never pleasant although they could have been more careful with the blade the high septon came to speak to me today he doesn't want me to arrest you he wants me to execute you i wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter my thoughts on the matter are in line with your own the high septon behavior was corrosive as was his attitude i didn't come here to sweep floors and it all because my brother died having a man like that reside in the sept eats away at the faith from the inside so now he resides in the red keep dungeons instead the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other we must do everything necessary to protect one another your grace <i> send a raven with this message</i> to littlefinger at the eyrie or wherever he slithering about at once your grace how your work coming along i understand very well you've made progress more than i expected still a way to go but very good i'll leave you to it then make sure littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately " shh easy friend she really is lovely i hope i can make her happy but it not your fault you know that don't you i hope so too i've become quite fond of lady sansa during our travels together she suffered enough i'll never hurt her you have my word i've heard very little about you which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go i haven't been a lord very long i was a bastard and you're not anymore you mustn't feel guilty allow me a momant alone with lord baelish yes father and thank you lord baelish i'm forever in your debt he seems pleased shouldn't he be i assure you she still a virgin tyrion never consummated the marriage by the law of the land she is no man wife inspect her if you must i don't feel guilty i'll leave that to the brothel keeper it her name i need not her virtue then i have delivered everything i promised and you're prepared for the consequences when the lannisters hear i've wed sansa stark to ramsay the lannister name doesn't mean what it once did tywin is dead he kept his house in power through sheer will without him jaime has one hand and no allies tomman is a soft boy that what odd not a king to fear the queen will be enraged <i>queen margaery</i> adores sansa cersei is queen mother a title whose importance wanes with each passing day and yet she still has friends man in important places whom she can ask for favors a message for you from cersei lannister a rider arrived from the eyrie shortly before dawn apparently she thinks you're still in the vale do you like to sail a message for me you say strange that the seal is broken i'm sure you understand my position lord baelish if you receive word in the night from the queen mother it does make me question our new alliance the lannisters made you one of the great lords of westeros yet here you are in the north undermining them why gamble with your position every ambitious move is a gamble you gambled when you drove a dagger into robb stark heart i love to sail it appears that your gamble paid off you're warden of the north i had tywin lannister backing who supports me now you the eyrie is mine the last time the lords of the eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the north they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known i'd like to borrow one of your birds cersei will expect a reply i do too i'd like to

us know the castle as well as you do its hidden tunnels its weaknesses not after we've kidnapped their princess its people winterfell was your home once don't you want to chase the rats out of it castle black is my home now <i>the night watch take no part in the wars of the seven kingdoms </i> there only one war life against death come let me show you what you're fighting for you're gonna show me some vision in the fire forgive me my lady i don't trust in visions we're not kidnapping their princess no visions no magic just life do you feel my heart beating there power in you you resist it and that your mistake embrace it the lord of light made us male and female two parts of a greater whole in our joining there power power to make life we're rescuing my niece bringing her back to her family power to make light and power to cast shadows i don't think stannis would like that very much then we shouldn't tell him i can't why i swore a vow i loved another the dead don't need lovers only the living i know your niece but i still love her you know nothing jon snow are you lonely just bored my father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources were you bored a lot too i know castle black is no place for a child but i like it i thought i'd be left at home i've been doing this sort of thing a long time i know mother didn't want to bring me why do you say that she told me "i don't want to bring you " she shouldn't have said that are you ashamed of me father when you were an infant a dornish trader landed on dragonstone his goods were junk except for one wooden doll he had even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house no doubt he had heard of your birth i'm good at it that why you're here and assumed new fathers were easy targets i still remember how you smiled when i put that doll in your cradle how you pressed it to your cheek by the time we burned the doll it was too late i was told you would die or worse the greyscale would go slow <i>let you grow just enough</i> <i>to know the world</i> <i>before taking it away from you </i> everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of valyria i know why are you here to live out your short life with the stone man <i>before the sickness</i> <i>spread through the castle </i> i told them all to go to hell <i>i called in every maester</i> <i>on this side of the world </i> every healer every apothecary they stopped the disease and saved your life 'cause you did not belong across the world with the bloody stone man you are the princess shireen of house baratheon and you are my daughter tarth ser jaime why not send 40 of me or an army <i>i thought i might find you here </i> <i>your aunt lyanna </i> father never talked about her sometimes i'd find him down here lighting the candles they say she was beautiful i saw her once i was a boy living with your mother family lord whent held a great tourney at harrenhal everyone was there the mad king your father unlike most folks you've actually got one robert baratheon and lyanna she was already promised to robert you can imagine what it was like for me a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name watching these legendary man tilting at the lists the last two riders were barristan selmy and rhaegar targaryen when rhaegar won everyone cheered for their prince because i don't want to start a war i remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair how handsome he was until he rode right past his wife elia martell and all the smiles died i've never seen so many people so quiet he rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in lyanna lap blue as frost that still doesn't explain what you're doing here how many tens of thousands had to die because rhaegar chose your aunt yes he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her come let speak somewhere the dead can't hear us you're dressed for riding i am where are you going king landing it has to be me king landing cersei sent for me we mustn't let her sniff out any trouble you can't leave me here i know how hard it is to live with people you despise believe me but it won't be for long how do you know stannis baratheon garrisons at castle black he'll march south to king landing if i'm putting something like this together before the winter snows block his way but first he has to take winterfell you don't know that i do once he liberates these lands from the boltons he'll rally your father bannerman to his cause with the north behind him stannis can finally take the iron throne you think he'll defeat the boltons he has a larger army he the finest military commander in westeros a onehanded man who happens to be a betting man would put his money on stannis as it happens i am a betting man and if you're right stannis takes winterfell he rescues you from the most despised family in the north grateful for your late father courageous support of his claim he names you wardeness of the north but i i wouldn't wardeness of the north one of the most recognizable faces in westeros is not you are the last surviving stark he needs you and what if you're wrong what if stannis never attacks winterfell or he does and the boltons defeat him then you will take this bolton boy ramsay and make him yours i don't know how to do that of course you do he already fallen for you it has to be me his father frightens me he should he a dangerous man but even the most dangerous man can be outmaneuvered and you've learned to maneuver from the very best i'll return before too long you'll be strong without me the north will be yours do you believe me i expect i'll be a married woman by the time you return breakfast you set your brother free didn't you that would have been a shit way to die as far as i've seen they're all shit ways to die aye but your lot have to give the singers a good ending i don't care what sung about me when i'm dead no two knights off to rescue a princess sounds like a good song to me sounds like all the rest what about you what shit way would you choose the sapphire isle i'll bet your sister didn't like that in my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune how disappointing i thought you'd have something more exciting planned i've had an exciting life i want my death to be boring how do you want to go in the arms of the woman i love she want the same thing let go varys set him free the captain of that ship what was he braavosi pentoshi and he headed to oldtown as i said why what to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that jaime lannister is in dorne a bag of gold i'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world well if you ever see the wee fucker it was a heavy bag and i bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it but you won't be around if he breaks 'em <i>how many you count</i> four how many do you think you can take one if he slow halt over the hill fucked in the ass give him my regards hyah morning lads glad we found you who are you cooper this is darnell you're from king landing accent gave me away flea bottom whelped and whipped why are you here he murdered my father our ship capsized in the night we managed to swim ashore it was a near thing really thought the sharks would get us there are no sharks in dorne could have sworn those were shark fins dolphins maybe throw your swords in the sand boys there no need for this just point us in the right direction if i ever see him i'll split him in two we'll find our way home swords in the sand now hyah hyah that one should be slow enough <i>nice move </i> luck you had a wonderful teacher always wanted a dornish stallion beasts can run a day and night without tiring we'll ride to the water gardens and then i'll give him your regards with a nice breeze in our faces first we need to bury these bodies birds have to eat too corpses raise questions questions raise armies we're not here to start a war do you know how long it'll take us to dig all those holes i can't dig very well with one hand not at all really mama nym obara the iron bank has called in onetenth of the crown debts will it be war prince doran will weep for your father but nothing else we must avenge oberyn ourselves without doran we have no army to march against the lannisters we don't need an army to start a war <i>queen cersei loves her children </i> and we have one of them you may have a problem a ship captain who found me in planky town claiming he had information to sell given the expense of rebuilding the royal fleet he told me he smuggled jaime lannister into dorne he come for myrcella if he gets to her before we do we lose our only chance for revenge you must choose doran way and peace or my way and war i'm with you always nym obara how much can the crown afford when i was a child oberyn came to take me to court i had never seen this man and yet he called himself my father my mother wept said i was too young and a girl oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said "girl or boy we fight our battles but the gods let us choose our weapons " my father pointed to the spear and then to my mother tears why are we on a merchant ship <i>with winter coming </i> i made my choice long ago will you untie me <i>will you please untie me</i> will you please thank you who are you your captor do you have wine <i>no </i> can't sleep without wine half what they ask less then stay awake you're going the wrong way my sister is in westeros westeros is west we're heading east <i>i'm not taking you</i> <i>to your sister </i> you said you were taking me to the queen i am queen daenerys targaryen she the queen i serve what a waste of a good kidnapping you're the master of coin how do we pay them it so happens i was heading there myself what business would you have with the queen gold and glory oh and hate if you'd ever met my sister you'd understand so now that it clear we are on the same side <i>a highborn knight from the north of westeros</i> down on his luck in essos dragon epaulets bear sigil breastplate you're jorah mormont <i>i have to ask </i> house tyrell could front the gold how exactly were you serving your queen in a whorehouse half a world away is it possible that you were running why would you be running and why would she have sent you away oh wait you were spying on her weren't you <i>it all coming back to me </i> i was drunk through most of the small council meetings but it all coming back and the crown would pay us back in time you passed notes to varys little birds <i>she found out didn't she</i> <i>found out and exiled you </i> now you hope to win back her favor with a gift risky scheme <i>one might even say desperate </i> you think daenerys will execute me and pardon you i'd say the reverse is just as likely everyone looks happy enough from up here what or i'd have words with my daughter i was thinking about all the times your brother made me go with him down from the red keep into the streets of king landing why he liked to walk among the people he liked to sing to them he sang to them yes rhaegar would pick a spot on the hook or the street of seeds and then he'd sing just like all the other minstrels you've already given us too much and what did you do i made sure no one killed him and i collected the money what he liked to see how much he could make he was good he was very good viserys never told you he told me rhaegar was good at killing people rhaegar never liked killing he loved singing and what did you do with the money no we must arrange better terms with the iron bank well one time he gave it to the next minstrel down the street one time he gave it to an orphanage in flea bottom one time we got horribly drunk your grace hizdahr is here waiting in the audience chamber how many others are there 50 100 will you be joining us ser barristan i think i can protect you from hizdahr zo loraq i think i can protect me from hizdahr zo loraq absolutely in person go ser barristan sing a song for me your grace all man must die but not all can die in glory glory why else do man fight why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea and conquer the seven kingdoms so their names would live on those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on me we must send an envoy to the iron bank it the best chance they'll ever have is that what you used to tell man before you set them to butchering each other for sport your grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season i do not recognize this tradition traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common nothing but centuries of mistrust and

all doubt so how did you manage it manage what getting her pregt i imagine you're familiar with the procedure of course but how did you find it you disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the stark girl she sounds like quite a woman and if it a boy you're worried about your position my position is quite clear i'm your son until a better alternative comes along you've never asked me about your mother why would i she had me she died and here we are she was a peasant girl and she alone pretty in a common sort of way she was the miller wife apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent so i had him hanged and i took her beneath the tree where he was swaying she fought me the whole time she was lucky i didn't hang her too <i>a year later</i> <i>she came to my gates</i> <i>with a squalling baby</i> <i>in her arms </i> <i>a baby she claimed was mine </i> under siege i nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river but then i looked at you <i>and i saw then what i see now </i> you are my son stannis baratheon has an army at castle black but he won't stay for long he wants the iron throne and the road to king landing comes right through winterfell he means to take the north "barristan the bold" they called him no family to guide her or protect her but the north is ours it yours and mine will you help me defeat him yes is this every book there is every book there is in the world well no there are thousands and thousands of books out there this library is rather small actually where you grew up were there more books her last relation thousands of miles away my father not the most literate man they say the citadel has the largest library in the world where that the citadel in oldtown i'm sorry i don't know things gilly look at me <i>you know how to do a hundred things i can never do </i> you can build a fire with wet wood you can cook you can stitch a wound useless dying i can wash the linens i can sweep the floor well why does the citadel have the biggest library <i>it where they train</i> <i>the maesters </i> like maester aemon i wanted to be one when i was young instead i became a man of the night watch far more adventure up here anyway i wouldn't have met you ah your grace you're samwell tarly don't say that maester aemon i am your grace your father is randyll tarly he defeated my brother at the battle of ashford <i>only battle robert ever lost </i> i told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon but he never listened <i>fine soldier your father </i> you don't look like a soldier but i'm told you killed a white walker i did your grace <i>how</i> a targaryen alone in the world with a dagger made of dragonglass dragonglass what the maesters call obsidian i know what it is we have it in dragonstone why would obsidian kill a walker i don't know i've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something and all i've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass the lady melisandre told me that death marches on the wall is a terrible thing i've seen it your grace seen what the army of the dead and when they come we have to know how to fight them keep reading samwell tarly it time uh your grace wouldn't it be better to wait when jon snow returns with the wildlings we could have thousands more man if jon snow returns with the wildlings maester aemon we can't wait that long we have the advantage more man more horses all fed and rested <i>but every day we wait the odds shift in bolton favor </i> this could turn to winter at any momant we have to act now give the order we march at sunrise i'll choose a dozen man to stay and guard the queen and the princess no need they're coming with us it a tough road ahead your grace lord commander won't they be safer here half these watchman are killers and rapists no they march with us as you wish your grace <i> do you think father will let me go down into the crypt</i> beg your pardon at winterfell all the kings in the north are buried there bran the builder and king dorren and first things first it a long march ahead sam i'd like to speak to the maester alone and then we have to take the castle is there going to be a battle aye princess but you won't be anywhere near that enough talk of battle ser davos you'll scare the child <i>yes my queen </i> i'm not scared well i

because when the knife go in and i fall to the ground i am afraid all man fear death no not death i fear i need your advice i never again see missandei from the island of naath now you have given the masters what they deserve if i give everyone what they deserve i'll have no one left to rule ser barristan counseled mercy when i took this city right up to the morning he died <i>daario naharis thinks i should kill the former masters</i> <i>and let the rest of the city fend for itself </i> what do you think your grace i think that i am not fit there something i want to do something i to have an opinion on these matters you are as fit as anyone i know you know why i'm here and you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart <i>so what do you think</i> i can only tell you what i have seen your grace i have seen you listen to your counselors i have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you and i have seen you ignore your counselors have to do because there was a better choice one that only you could see my my queen please do not do this <i>what about "valar morghulis"</i> i did not want to die a coward apparently i do not want to die at all it takes courage to admit fear and to admit a mistake i came here to tell you that i was wrong i was wrong and you were right but it'll divide the night watch about tradition about bringing the people of this city together i will reopen the fighting pits to free man only slavery will never return to meereen not while i live yes my queen and in order to forge a lasting bond with the meereenese people i will marry the leader of an ancient family thankfully a suitor is already on his knees don't worry bitterly i'll be fine nothing broken i don't think where are we now not the rhoyne long sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face the mormont way let start over i apologize for before <i>my mouth sometimes</i> <i>runs away from me </i> this doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip half the man will hate me the momant i give the order we're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to meereen we are what would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine no wine i am a person who drinks people who drink need to keep drinking <i>otherwise they're not </i> i know where we are you're taking us through valyria half the man hate you already lord commander i am have you sailed this route before no you're going to bring daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case i'm not enough i think you'll be plenty <i>you know what they say </i> the doom still rules valyria what about the demons and the flames <i>aren't you afraid of the doom</i> do it <i>no </i> but pirates are oh the smoking sea how many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again thousands of years the valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything and then and then they weren't he was a loyal friend but you don't know what it is and then they weren't "they held each other close and turned their backs upon the end <i>the hills that split asunder</i> and the black that ate the skies; the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes a fly upon a wall the waves the sea wind whipped and churned" that doesn't matter "the city of a thousand years and all that man had learned; the doom consumed it all alike and neither of them turned " i would clap i suppose this is it then this is what remains what was that stone man don't let them touch you you do get behind mormont cut me free mormont mormont mormont tyrion tyrion tyrion tyrion you're all right you will find little joy in your command you're heavier than you look did any of them touch you you i've seen greyscale before but nothing like that i suppose that why they send them there it'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it thank you for saving me of course i wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place but with luck so what now we walk up the coast with luck we'll find a fishing village maybe another boat without luck we've got a long walk ahead of us i'll get some wood for a fire try to get some rest huh that the best idea you've had all day <font color="#ec14bd">sync & corrections by honeybunny</font> <font color="#ec14bd">www addic7ed com</font> you will find the strength to do what needs to be done kill the boy jon snow winter is almost upon us kill the boy and let the man be born and he died in an alley where are the rest of the free folk now where have they gone who leads them they followed mance they won't follow anyone else what about you hard to lead when you're in chains what if i unchained you why would you do that because you are not my enemy butchered by cowards who hide behind masks and i'm not yours you sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends for 8 000 years the night watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of man and for 8 000 years we've fallen short of that oath you belong to the realms of man all of you and now everything is going to change it is why now because now i am lord commander of the night watch we could pull back to the pyramid district what would you have me do lord commander i'd have you go north of the wall gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here i'll open the gates for them and let them through i'll find them lands to settle south of the wall they won't kneel for you and neither will i i don't want them to kneel for me i want them to fight with me when the time comes the day i ask my people to fight with the crows 0 game of thrones s05e06 unbowed unbent unbroken srt what are they doing with the bodies game i only know what i heard how <i>he was leading an expedition beyond the wall </i> there was a mutiny he was murdered by his own man we better keep moving valar morghulis valar dohaeris i have nowhere else to go i've taken her to every healer in braavos the game the game of faces i've spent every penny i had she suffers every day of her life i just want it to end it hurts i know don't be afraid i used to be like you i was sick i was dying but my father never gave up on me you tried already you failed he loved me more than anything in the world just like your father loves you so he brought me here my father prayed to the manyfaced god and i drank the water from his fountain it healed me i've devoted my life to him now you don't want to hurt anymore drink i didn't even know i was playing <i>is a girl ready</i> to give up her ears her nose her tongue <i>her hopes and dreams </i> <i>her loves and hates</i> all that makes a girl who she is forever no a girl is not ready to become no one but she is ready to become someone else why daenerys why is she worth all this as i recall the mormonts fought against the targaryens who are you during robert rebellion do you believe in anything i believe in lots of things in something greater than ourselves i mean the gods destiny do you believe there a plan for this world no neither did i i was a cynic just like you then i saw a girl step into a great fire no one with three stone eggs when the fire burned out i thought i'd find her blackened bones instead i saw her daenerys alive and unhurt holding her baby dragons have you ever heard baby dragons singing no it hard to be a cynic after that doesn't mean she going to be a great queen <i>no it doesn't </i> the targaryens are famously insane get back to work what if she conquers the world then what 1 000 years of peace and prosperity first we have to conquer the world we all right let assume your dreams come true <i>she ecstatic when you</i> <i>bring her this enemy dwarf </i> <i>she hacks off my head</i> <i>and restores your position </i> you command her army sail to westeros defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps and sit on the iron throne who are you hurrah long live the queen then what then she rules so a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in westeros becomes the ruler of westeros that justice she the rightful heir why because her father who burned living man for amusemant was the king that a slave ship why are they anchored they probably came ashore for <i> water </i> got a lot of fight in you huh what are you doing here how did you get here salt mines yeah that or a galley slave <i>he looks strong enough </i> what about the dwarf worthless cut his throat wait wait wait wait wait let discuss this and then chop off his cock we'll sell it for a fortune a dwarf cock has magic powers i'm from westeros just like you wait wait wait wait wait you can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it he has to know it came from a dwarf and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf it will be a dwarfsized cock guess again the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant queen daenerys has outlawed slavery get back to work daughter of a lord just like you we're bound for volantis not slaver bay besides she reopened the fighting pits i've never heard of free man fighting in the pits <i>the fighting pits in meereen</i> you're in luck then you're about to be rich you are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms him him he got to be 60 years old sure he a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long except i was an only child we can all see that but he is a veteran of 100 battles they wrote songs about him that true he won the tournamant at lannisport unseating ser jaime lannister himself the kingslayer jousting you're talking about jousting a fancy game for fancy lads the man who fight in the pits of meereen will swallow him whole i killed a dothraki bloodrider in single combat heir to his fortune liar it no lie his name was qotho he was bloodrider to khal drogo take me to slaver bay put a sword in my hand i'll prove my worth for my children money lord baelish yes lancel lannister brother lancel my mother died we abandon our family names quite a family to abandon the city has changed since you were here last we flooded the gutters with wine smashed the false idols and set the godless on the run well done i'm here on urgent business for the queen mother should i send word that i'll be delayed step carefully lord baelish my father remarried and his new wife you'll find there little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new king landing we both peddle fantasies brother lancel mine just happen to be entertaining do you think it wise your grace arresting the heir to highgarden the faith arrested the heir to highgarden of course and the faith were armed on your orders the king orders is the king to blame for ser loras perversion gave birth to a girl house tyrell won't tolerate this insult house tyrell won't tolerate it i'm the insulted party lord baelish ser loras was promised to me instead he chose the company of boys one choice of companion is a curious thing most curious lysa arryn for instance thoroughly repellant woman forgive me my stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter i know you're still in mourning lysa was a good woman a kind woman <i>she was neither of those things we both know it </i> still i pity her son how fortunate the young lord of the vale <i>has a new father to counsel him </i> i know how hard it can be to lose both your parents at such a young age if war comes to westeros will the knights of the vale fight for their king so she tried to kill me with poison young lord robin heeds my advice and i have always counseled loyalty to the throne good if there nothing else there is another matter your grace something so urgent i couldn't trust the words to a raven you once charged me with finding arya stark to my shame i failed you but i have found sansa stark alive and well and home again i found out living at winterfell that not possible my sources are well placed they tell me roose bolton plans to marry her to his son ramsay a bastard recently legitimized by king tomman roose bolton is warden of the north by the grace of my father indeed his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart we were fools to trust a turncloak marrying his son to the last of the starks sought help from the faceless man gives him more legitimacy in the north than an alliance with a hated southern house i will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on their bloody sigil i would counsel patience your grace patience sansa helped murder my son roose bolton is a traitor stannis baratheon is also a traitor marching with his army on winterfell no i've been here for weeks and my father was widowed again let stannis and roose battle let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize winterfell from whichever thief survives winterfell is 1 000 miles away from here the weather has already begun to turn that is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds surely your uncle kevan could muster a force my uncle kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse ser jaime then i've been serving them ever since <i>jaime away on a sensitive diplomatic mission </i> i have no idea when he'll be back <i>perhaps i can help </i> the knights of the vale are some of the best fighters in westeros trained to battle in the ice and the snow forgive me lord baelish you have a reputation as a moneylender and a brothel keeper not a military man you wouldn't risk a single lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury was that true or a lie what do you have to lose a brothel keeper and if you succeed name me warden of the north i'll speak to the king this evening have him issue a royal decree i'll not rest until the lion flies over winterfell and i'll know you're a man of your word when i see sansa stark head on a spike as i said what i live to serve i'm going to ask him tomorrow what if he says no he won't we've waited long enough i want you to be my wife now what is it do you want to marry me because our families arranged it or do you we can't not yet did you believe every word i said why not you know why not someone will see you are going to be my wife i am going to be your husband we're allowed to walk through the gardens together how many other girls have you walked through these gardens i like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous they do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question they make a lovely couple a lannister and a martell get back to work <i>they have no idea</i> <i>how dangerous that is </i> we must protect them yes my prince you haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time i hope you remember how i remember how <i> ♪ the dornishman wife was as fair as the sun ♪</i> ♪ and her kisses were warmer than spring ♪ ♪ the dornishman blade ♪ ♪ it was made of black steel ♪ <i>who are you</i> ♪ and its kiss was a terrible thing ♪ ♪ the dornishman wife would sing as she bathed ♪ ♪ in a voice that was sweet as a peach ♪ all right that enough i'm coming to the best part we're trying to blend in don't want everyone in dorne to hear your accent this song really is all about the ending it can wait there that the water gardens <i>and once we've got the princess then what</i> who are you i like to improvise that explains the golden hand unbowed unbent unbroken for oberyn for oberyn well she made herself at home myrcella uncle jaime i i don't understand what are you doing here arya let speak in private i am trystane martell trystane is my intended excellent good to meet you we weren't expecting you lord jaime why don't you let them have some time alone son let not do something stupid that was something stupid we have to go myrcella now you hurt him he'll be fine i promise but we have to and where did you come from oh for fuck sake take her you're coming with me i don't want to i wasn't asking princess ah drop your weapons <i>i am obara sand </i> daughter of oberyn martell i fight for dorne who do you fight for drop your weapons when you were whole it would have been a good fight i'm not scrubbing one more corpse <i>westeros </i> you fight pretty good for a little girl halt oh you can smell the shit from five miles away well why have we stopped go on rumors and gossip that all they've got it theater nothing more if they arrested all the pillow biters in king landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else everyone knew about him and renly renly baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the seven kingdoms my family home is winterfell everyone knew no one cared but he was the king brother and loras is the queen brother no no no no this is unacceptable cersei behind it yeah of course she is she wants to drag our name through the dirt put us in our place get some rest dear you look appalling let me deal with cersei lannister your grace i have travelled a long way i'm the youngest daughter of a great lord you must be exhausted put the pen down dear we both know you're not writing anything ah yes the famously tarttongued queen of thorns and the famous tart queen cersei i beg your pardon i know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson if you apologize for that commant perhaps i'll you'll get your apology when i get loras i was as shocked as anyone when the faith arrested ser loras eddard stark i have no love for these fanatics but what can a queen mother do has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies i can assure you our alliance with house tyrell remains do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison as i said i didn't imprison anyone he died in battle as for your veiled threats what veil the lannistertyrell alliance brought peace to a wartorn country do you really want to see the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare i didn't trust your father <i>i didn't particularly like him </i> <i>but i respected him </i> <i>he was no fool </i> he understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them house lannister has no rival a lie the high septon has called for an inquest not a trial just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against loras have merit which i'm sure they don't loras will be freed our happy alliance will continue and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened good day lady olenna you are aware of the rumors concerning you and renly i don't pay attention to rumors <i>you were said to be despondent when he died </i> after he was executed i fled the capital witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside even as stannis army closed in he was my friend he was my king wasn't joffrey your king <i>he was anointed</i> <i>by the seven not renly </i> i was wrong to support renly claim i know that but i was forgiven by joffrey i fought for him at the battle of blackwater yes wearing renly armor why does it matter what i wore had to kill a stable boy do you deny all the charges against you fornication <i>buggery </i> <i>blasphemy </i> of course i deny them you never lay with renly baratheon never <i>nor any other man</i> never that will be all ser loras well i think that quite enough of that drove my sword through his back the faith calls queen margaery forward you call me forward yes we have some questions for you i am the queen you are and according to the law of the seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest how do you respond to these charges against your brother they are lies all of them all of them a lie <i>queen margaery </i> <i>in the presence of the gods </i> do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge yes i swear it thank you your grace do you know this man yes very well <i>he is ser loras tyrell </i> <i>heir to highgarden </i> until you tell me why i'm doing it i stabbed him in the gut how did you come to meet <i>i squired for him </i> he took a liking to me he summoned me to his chamber the first day we met and what occurred in his chamber we engaged in intimate relations you lay with him that night and many others liar he a liar is there anyone else who can support your claim <i>i tried to find</i> <i>my mother and brother </i> yes yes queen margaery <i>she walked in on us once</i> <i>not long ago </i> she didn't seem surprised this testimony is an insult to a great house why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden <i> he has a birthmark your grace </i> <i>quite high on his thigh </i> winecolored and roughly the shape of dorne <i>but i never did </i> no liar what are you doing let us pass the faith is satisfied there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial <i>for ser loras</i> and queen margaery what bearing false witness before the gods <i>is as grave a sin</i> <i>as any my lady </i> take her <i>they were murdered</i> <i>by walder frey </i> <i>no tomman </i> tomman you can't do this i am the queen tomman tomman <i>i am your queen </i> <i>how dare you</i> <i>take your hands off me</i> <i>tomman</i> what do you want lord ramsay sent me to draw you a bath my lady you want to be clean and fresh an outlaw kidnapped me a man called

travelling together in each other company therefore do you ever shut up i sailed from king landing to pentos in a crate <i>without ever saying a word </i> get back to work why it never occurred to you to ask why until now you never wondered why tyrion lannister decided to visit a brothel in volantis i'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities i killed my father he wanted to execute me for a crime i didn't commit and he was fucking the woman i loved as miserable as you are mormont at least your father was a good man when do i get to play the game what do you know about my father i met him

claim my pillow don't be ridiculous my marriage to hizdahr is political i think he smart enough to understand that i think the sons of the harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king are you jealous you think i'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition lord commander it is my duty to tell you theon i do you're right my motivations are entirely impure doesn't make me wrong you told me yourself i can't fight enemies within and without so when enemies without come knocking i need the city of meereen behind me i have no choice everyone has a choice even slaves have a choice do what he says death or slavery so what else can i do hmm marry me instead even if i wanted to do such an inadvisable thing i couldn't why not you are queen you can do what you like no i can't then you are the only person in meereen who not free and i know i'm here to serve my queen and not give advice do what he says or he'll hurt you but can i make one more suggestion of course on the day of the great games gather all the great masters and wise masters and worthy masters you can find and slaughter them all i am a queen not a butcher all rulers are either butchers or meat you there where would i find the high septon or high sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he got he already hurts me every night it not as good a name as queen of thorns i'll admit you should have the decency to stand when you speak to a lady you should have the decency to kneel before the gods don't spar with me little fellow for me it the knees you hips ah a man of the people is that your game it an old game dull and unconvincing all day i'm locked in this room a man of the people who does cersei dirty work for her the people always do the dirty work spare me the homilies i can smell a fraud from a mile away useful talent i'm here for my grandson and granddaughter your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied the father judges us all sons of high lords and every night he comes sons of fisherman if you break his laws you will be punished don't you walk away from me you don't give commands here lady olenna what is it you want gold i'll make you the richest septon who ever lived what then i imagine this is strange for you everyone you meet has a hidden motive it can't be any worse and you pride yourself on sniffing it out <i>but i'm telling you a simple truth </i> i serve the gods the gods demand justice how do they communicate their demands by raven or horse by the holy text "the sevenpointed star " if you don't have one in your library <i>i'll give you my own </i> i've read "the sevenpointed star " it can it can always be worse <i>then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury </i> your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws half the man woman and children in this foul city break the sacred laws you live among murderers thieves and rapists and yet you punish loras for shagging some perfumed ponce and margaery for defending her brother yes the gods' laws must be applied to all equally what did he do to you please if it equality you want so be it when house tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital everyone here will starve and i'll make sure the hungry know who to blame have you ever sowed the field lady olenna have you ever reaped the grain has anyone in house tyrell a lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye you are the few we are the many you betrayed my family i'm sorry i'm sorry and when the many stop fearing the few lady olenna starving yourself won't make things any better for her my love she in a prison cell and there is nothing i can do i am the king the queen is in prison and there is nothing i can do no matter who you are no matter how strong you are sooner or later i believe this mission to be reckless foolhardy you have to help me theon help me you'll face circumstances beyond your control events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had you cannot blame yourself for fate your father your brother your grandfather i was queen of the seven kingdoms and what could i do hold them as they left this world kissed their heads after they'd gone i'll call in the army he'll see us you don't know him i'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them i'll start a war if

will you love her very much don't you of course she my niece i wasn't talking about her you think i disapprove why because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from they disapproved of oberyn and me where you are from here no one blinked an eye i don't think that fact lost on them 100 years ago no one would have blinked an eye at you if you'd been named targaryen it always changing who we're supposed to love and who we're not the only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want i know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man i love perhaps even you are innocent of that father you have a good heart jon snow aren't you cold no what are you reading "the dance of dragons " what it about it the story of the fight between rhaenyra targaryen and her halfbrother aegon for control over the seven kingdoms both of them thought they belonged on the iron throne when people started declaring for one of them or the other their fight divided the kingdoms in two brothers fought brothers dragons fought dragons by the time it was over thousands were dead it'll get us all killed and it was a disaster for the targaryens as well they never truly recovered "the dance of dragons " why is that a dance it just what they call it hmm doesn't make much sense i think it poetic if you had to choose between rhaenyra and aegon who would you have chosen out of my way i wouldn't have chosen either it all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible sometimes a person has to choose sometimes the world forces his hand if a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is no choice at all he must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be however much he may hate it you sent for me your grace it all right father you don't even know what i'm talking about it doesn't matter i want to help you is there any way i can help yes there is good i want to i'm the princess shireen of house baratheon and i'm

make sure the night watch has all the man it requires _ they're waiting for you clap your hands that one the smaller man no question that where you should put your money the smaller man it is i'm not putting my money anywhere kings and queens never bet on the games perhaps you should go find someone who does people used to bet against me when i fought in the pits he can guard all 19 castles on the wall if he so wishes he would have bet against me common novice mistake i've spent much of my life in this arena and in my experience large man do triumph over smaller man far more often than not has your experience ever involved any actual fighting you yourself have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you whenever i got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me all skin and bone back then then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me your grace you named me your hand they couldn't get their money out fast enough but the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here and the big man were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't yes whenever i saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces i knew i could rest easy you don't approve there always been more than enough death in the world for my taste i can do without it in my leisure time yes fair enough yet it an unpleasant question but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty it easy to confuse what is with what ought to be especially when what is has worked out in your favor i'm not talking about myself i'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness that is greatness that is a vital part of the great city of meereen which existed long before you or i and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt the king hand should never abandon the king my father would have liked you _ one day your great city will return to the dirt as well at your command if need be _ and how many people will die to make this happen if it comes to that they will have died for a good reason those man think they're dying for a good reason someone else reason so your reasons are true and theirs are false especially in time of war they don't know their own minds but you do well said you're an eloquent man doesn't mean you're wrong in my experience eloquent man are right every bit as often as imbeciles _ _ _ your grace shut your mouth you can end this she cannot you're not abandoning me you're obeying a command you can protect your queen go your grace your grace
