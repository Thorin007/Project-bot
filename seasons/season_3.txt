imagination i want you to take it off mouth ser bronn ser bronn i didn't hear that apologies ser back away keep backing away till you're outside this establishmant then back away some more but we have to make it have to warn them lord tyrion sent me i will murder you boy he said it was a matter of life and death pod it your sister the queen what are they doing here protecting me i assume will you let me in no i don't think so if i wanted to kill you do you think i'd let a wooden door stop me or before winter done they stay outside i'm not afraid of you little brother why are you here i wanted to see your face they said you'd lost your nose but it not as gruesome as all that the man who cut me lost more than his nose i should hope so the rebels came for joffrey head they lost their own thanks to father everyone you've ever known will be dead thanks to father of course it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me no curious bit of a comedown from chamber of the hand but then i don't suppose you need much room grand maester pycelle made the same joke you must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees you're meeting father today how do you know that because i have hundreds of spies in my employ first time you've seen a giant jon snow the master of whisperers owes me a favour or two father told me what do you want from him what do i want from him he my father do i need to want something i'm sure he loves me dearly as any father loves his child his baby boy yet he hasn't come to visit once hmm since arriving in king landing i lay here my face split in half but father never came you're going to make me cry well don't stare too long they're shy why do you care what i want from him because you've slandered me to father before slandered when you told him i had my guards beat that servant girl at casterly rock you did have your guards beat her a girl of nine i believe i was nine too she lost an eye if i remember correctly if i remember correctly she never stole a necklace again it not slander if it true when they stop being shy they get angry and what this truth you plan on telling him today why are you so nervous about what i'm going to say to father because you're a liar i expect you'll tell lies about me about joffrey any lies in particular you're a clever man but not as clever as you think you are mmm still makes me more clever than you ah look at these two shining warriors and when they're angry ser taryn mant and ser whosit of whocares ser meryn trant ser bronn of the blackwater you're no knight pod ser bronn of the blackwater was anointed by the king himself you're an upjumped cutthroat nothing more that exactly who i am and you're a grub in fancy armour who better at beating little girls than fighting man now i have an appointmant with lord tyrion i've seen them pound a man straight into the ground you put your hand on that door you lose the hand as much as i appreciate a walk in the sunshine i am wondering why you sent for me many people in this city want to kill me you're here to protect me i've been doing that for a while now do you grow bored protecting me i grow poor protecting you poor poor under my patronage you've become a knight like a hammer on a nail you've served as commander of the city watch briefly i'm sure you filled your pockets and now my pockets are empty you've given me a taste for the finer things and if you want me protecting you you'll need to pay more i thought we were friends we are but i'm a sellsword i sell my sword i don't loan it out to friends as a favour brother crow crow how much double double i'm a knight now knights are worth double i don't even know how much i'm paying you now which means you can afford it here here help me who are you i was in the battle at blackwater look over there i was a captain and a knight aye ser and serving which king the one true king of westeros stannis baratheon i thought you were dead everyone thought you were dead and your son he may have swam ashore as you did no the wildfire took him i saw it i'm so sorry my friend crow i too have lost a son there is nothing worse in this world but davos you were a good father if i was a good father he'd still be here stannis lives he licks his wounds at dragonstone will you take me there there is nothing for me at dragonstone this war is not over not for you maybe but for salladhor saan the war is over we're both sworn to king stannis crow look over here look i am sworn to no man i promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory i delivered the ships stannis never gives up never now he will regroup he a broken man his fleet lies at the bottom of blackwater bay they say he sees no one not his generals not even his wife only the red woman whispering in his ear telling him what she sees in the flames and burning man alive look crow coming what they built a great fire when stannis returned all those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness they say she sang to them as they burned i'm a pirate you're a smuggler servants of darkness i'm thinking dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid take me back there please you cannot turn stannis against her maybe not but i could carve her heart out crow you could try if you fail they will burn you if you succeed they'll burn you and you've only just come back to life stay alive a little longer my friend you call me friend you drank with me on my wedding day and you drank with me on four of mine but i don't ask you for favours i have to stop her please do this for me when you are dead you're wearing the wrong colour i will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck we should set the siege lines 1 000 yards from harrenhal there won't be a siege the mountain can't defend a ruin the mountain will defend whatever tywin lannister tells him the lannisters have been running from us since oxcross i'd love a fight the man would love a fight i don't think we're going to get one two hundred northman slaughtered like sheep the debt will be repaid my friend mance was a ranger for them and for your sons will it they rot in the ground while their killer runs free the kingslayer won't remain free for long my best hunters are after him a mallister ser jeremy my father bannerman find her a chamber that will serve as a cell she your mother in your hearts all you crows want to fly free she freed jaime lannister the lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice water water this needs to be cleaned and closed what your name friend qyburn you're lucky to be alive lucky when i'm free will i be free to go the badge looks good on you almost as good as it looked on me are you enjoying your new position am i enjoying it i was very happy as hand of the king yes i heard how happy you were you brought a whore into my bed it wasn't your bed at the time i sent you here to advise the king i gave you real power and authority did you send the ravens crow crow you chose to spend your days as you always have bedding harlots and drinking with thieves occasionally i drank with the harlots what do you want tyrion why does everyone assume i want something can't i simply visit with my beloved father my beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield sure you will maester pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal i organised the defence of this city while you held court in the ruins of harrenhal i led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson the king quivered in fear behind the walls i bled in the mud for our family and as my reward i was trundled off to some dark little cell but what do i want a little bloody gratitude would be a start jugglers and singers require applause and i'll be free to kill you you are a lannister do you think i demanded a garland of roses every time i suffered a wound on a battlefield hmm now i have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion so tell me what you want i want what is mine by right jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles but he is a kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance got no respect this lot the day jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to casterly rock i am your son and lawful heir you want casterly rock it is mine by right we'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishmants during the battle of blackwater bay and when the time is right you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy got no fathers to slap them when they're foul and if you serve faithfully you will be rewarded with a suitable wife and i would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to casterly rock why why you ask that you who killed your mother to come into the world you are an illmade spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning man laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colours what happened to their fathers since i cannot prove that you are not mine and to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father sigil and his father before him but neither gods nor man will ever compel me to let you turn casterly rock into your whorehouse go now speak no more of your rights to casterly rock go some of them were killed by crows like you one more thing the next whore i catch in your bed i'll hang dorne it going to dorne why dorne it carrying silk and it supposed to bring back wine in exchange but it not coming back the captain tired of risking his life so king landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve don't look so grim jon snow he going to stay in dorne wait out the winter where it beautiful and warm i met some people in dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm don't ruin the game i told you i don't want to play what about that one there that one it going to volantis why because when i got on a ship in volantis it looked like that one that not how the game works if mance rayder likes you you'll live another day you're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer you've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why why should i make up a story when i know the truth because the truth is always either terrible or boring lovely day for it watching the ships lord baelish might i speak with lady sansa alone for a momant i saw your mother not long ago she very eager to see you and if he don't and your sister arya alive you said you'd take me home you said king landing was your home you are the property of the crown stealing you would be treason if you were to tell just one person i won't tell anyone how do i know because i'm a terrible liar you said so yourself tarly look at me i smell a crow please lord baelish tell me what to do tell me when i'm waiting for word on an assignmant that will take me far away from the capital when i set sail i might be able to take you with me but you'll need to be ready to leave on a momant notice you're her handmaiden yes and you're his i help manage his affairs he an important person so is she i grew up in the shadow of her father castle we killed his friends thought you'd want to question this one the day she was born they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset we've both done rather well you and i yes given where we started and where is that it not easy for girls like us to dig our way out watch out for her i always do watch out for her with him they're growing fast what do we want with a baby crow not fast enough i can't wait that long i need an army we'll be in astapor by nightfall some say the unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world the greatest slavesoldiers in the world the distinction means a good deal to some people do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the iron throne it too beautiful a day to argue this baby killed qhorin halfhand you're right another lovely day on the high seas don't mock them they're the first dothraki on a ship they followed me across the poison water if they'll do it others will and with a true khalasar the dothraki follow strength above all khaleesi you'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong and not before your grace he wants to be one of us i heard you were dead not yet i had hoped to speak to you alone your grace we are alone your grace you are the rightful king not only by blood you're an honourable man a just man and there is still a war to fight i am fighting by burning prisoners alive that halfhanded cunt killed friends of mine how would you punish the infidels ser davos i do not judge people for the gods they worship if i did i'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on dragonstone i'm not your enemy you are my enemy was it me you fought on blackwater bay did i set your ships ablaze i wasn't there when the wildfire killed our man by the thousands friends twice your size i could have saved those man you would have taken the city stannis would sit upon his rightful throne and you would stand beside him but i wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind do you hear them screaming all those burning man in the water crying for their mothers for their gods for help until the momant the blackwater swallowed them don't despair ser davos my father told me big man fall just as quick as little ones what i told your son is true death by fire is the purest death this woman is evil she the mother of demons take him and lock him in a cell your grace come on you've chosen the darkness ser davos she will destroy us all i will pray for you your grace if you put a sword through their hearts halt down halt down why have we stopped it lady margaery your grace what is she doing who gave her permission my lady we should have guards my lady why pardon me stop my lady you'll ruin your dress i have others plenty of little man tried to put their swords through my heart would you like to speak with her your grace no he was a soldier he went to fight on the walls when the ships came into blackwater bay he never came back and your mother she died when she had me bad man wanted to come into this city and do terrible things but your father stopped them whenever you look at this knight did you send the ravens and there plenty of little skeletons i want you to remember your father he wasn't a knight he was just a soldier and what do knights swear to do protect the weak and uphold the good your father did that be proud of him was your father a soldier too you should be proud too under king joffrey leadership your fathers saved the city they saved us all from now on we're going to take care of you buried in the woods all of you come to me for what you need to feed them clothe them

touched by your concern your grace luckily for us tyrells our blood runs quite warm doesn't it loras yes loras isn't the queen gown magnificent the fabric the embroidery the metalwork jon snow i've

complemant of guards that didn't stop them the king barely escaped with his life my mother always had a penchant for drama facts become less and less important to her as she grows older our lives were never truly in danger you're right of course your grace but you are your father son we can't all have a king bravery hunger turns man into beasts i'm glad house tyrell has been able to help in this regard they tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the reach wheat barley apples we've had a blessed harvest and it our duty to assist the capital in time of need well as ser loras said lady

strongholds sow their fields with salt and no one will think of rebelling for another century it is a good match but what do you think of her she beautiful and intelligent yes she is her concern with the wellbeing there was a boy i don't want to hear about it of the common people is interesting not to me i only meant to go out of your way to endanger this is becoming one of the most boring conversations i've ever had margaery tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason she dresses like a harlot for a reason married a traitor and known degenerate like renly baratheon for a reason she married renly baratheon because she was told to that what intelligent woman do what they're told but you asked we've got plenty of worries you need to ask yourself i don't need to do anything better much better i still don't believe it he didn't want anything he just takes an interest because he loved my mother man only want one thing from a pretty girl littlefinger not in love with me love is not the thing he wants we don't need to pour black magic on top of them he too old they never see it that way he didn't ask you to do something for him spy on someone or no if he does ask you for

knows we're alive father liked him and so did loras loras is young and good at knocking man off horses with a stick that does not make him wise as to your fathead father grandmother what will sansa think of us she might think we have some wits about us one of us at any rate it was treason i warned them robert has two sons and renly has an older brother how can he possibly have any claim to that

fashion i prayed for my son bran to survive his fall i never thought i'd marry anyone at all many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox maester luwin said if he made it through the night he'd live but it would be a very long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breaths his coughing his whimpering which boy jon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i couldn't bear to look at him i didn't want to see those brown never stranger eyes staring up at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer i'd condemned this poor innocent child to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he didn't even know so i prayed to all seven gods let the boy live not until i met the king of the grim bearded stinking barbarians let him live and i'll love him i'll be a mother to him i'll beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us and he lived and he lived and i couldn't keep my promise and everything that happened since then all this horror that come to my family

on we'll talk more over brown bread and stew and then you can go on your way here the thing fat boy when i'm done talking that arrow falling down on your fat head so i advise you move because i'm done talking half the country starving and look at this one maybe he the reason half the country starving my lion we've spoken of this you can't kill it you know or theon may have taken them to the iron islands as hostages you cannot come here but you said i should come to you with any problems did anyone see you no you sure my father does not make idle threats having you killed would be the high point of his week you have to be absolutely certain all right what is this problem i'm worried about sansa when she spoke with lord baelish have you received any demands his friend warned me about him baelish doesn't have friends i don't know her name oh ros the redhead how do you know her i try to know as many people as i can you never know which one you'll need she a whore yes well we shouldn't be judgemantal about these things you fucked her no oh please all right yes i fucked her once twice but since i met you my lady i've been with no one else and was she good did you like her not as much as i like you obviously or she'd be the one torturing me right now what did she say about littlefinger that sansa shouldn't trust him is there an idiot in any village who trusts littlefinger have you heard anything from theon at all we have to protect her we can't now that the lannisters have discarded her sansa will have many suitors a great beauty with a very old name a great beauty oh a great beauty yes she is objectively very her face is quite pleasing to other man and to woman people in general but not to me of course i only have eyes for you where am i you pervert you want her this child i don't even want to talk about her but you are only because you're making me i didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out this is cruel and unfair cruelly unfair aw "the cruelty shae is so cruel to me " mmm yes who are you now do you think i'm cruel only if you stop but you mustn't come here again do you hear me you've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people dangerous people mmm lady tyrell my king send her in you wanted to see me your grace i'm leaving on a hunting trip what do you want i just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before i left that very thoughtful your grace i have everything i could want good good how are you finding life in the capital it must be quite a change after renly camp a welcome one a military encampmant is no place for a lady and the bedside of a traitor is that a place for a lady i want to do this your grace i tried to do my duty as a wife that is all what was your duty to this traitor as you saw it the duty of any wife to any husband to provide him with children you failed to do this why i i would not speak ill of the dead you think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor 'cause he had a sword put through his heart no i do beg your pardon do you know how long it'll take to get to king landing the subtleties of politics are often lost on me renly i don't believe he was interested in the company of woman what makes you say this whenever i wanted to make a child with him he he had so many excuses so many latenight war councils he never wanted to try except one evening after he'd had far too much wine to drink he suggested something something that sounded very painful walking through fields and forests and couldn't possibly result in children maybe the fault was with me no he was a known degenerate it such a relief to hear you say so your grace mmm i've considered making his perversion punishable by death as is your right you must do whatever you need to do you are the king yes why not yes i am do you like it i just had it made probably one of the finest weapons in the seven kingdoms it beautiful will you show me how it works it a new design much easier to load there no crank you use this lever to draw the string the bolt goes here and then you just aim and how shall we pass the time would you take me hunting sometime forgive me your grace i know a hunt is no place for a woman it not unheard of my father would never let me before you no longer belong to him do you want to hold it may i please i imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there could you do it by putting one foot in front of the other could you kill something i don't know your grace do you think i could yes would you like to watch me yes stop stop tell us the truth about what i don't know what you want i want the truth it going to be a very dull walk what truth why'd you take winterfell i took it to i took it who gave the orders no one i took it on my own why to take the north while vulnerable and once you took it hold it rule it good that very good why did you do that i told you i'm here to take you to king landing why did you take winterfell i took it to bring glory to my house and my father wait wait wait wait i took it because i hated the starks i hated them for holding me prisoner i wanted to hurt them what are you doing please i'll tell you anything just take it off please please just take it off your sister sent me yara i'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps and bring back lady stark daughters in exchange

can get inside his head see through his eyes only when i'm asleep that how it begins until you learn to control it you're a warg dull is fine it not just wolves sometimes in my dreams there a a threeeyed raven you've seen it we saw him together you haven't forgotten does it have anything to do with warging no the raven is something different something deeper the raven brings the sight seeing things that haven't happened yet or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away you know it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are what he telling him why don't you ask isn't he ashamed your brother needing you to protect him where the shame in that any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting some people will always need help that doesn't mean they're not worth helping when my father died i dreamt it you didn't dream it you saw it so did i no one enjoys the company of a humourless mute you have the sight too when i told my father about your father for the first time in my life i saw him cry your father is howland reed yeah he saved my father life during the rebellion your father told you about the rebellion mine never did but i saw that too what else have you seen only one thing that matters trust me on this you i never liked the skinny ones like drinking from a puddle not that i'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again i don't drink ale there no story so good a drink won't make it better yeah you see they've suffered through my bouts of sobriety it very tedious for all concerned now how did three children we're not children because the raven is you people have been serving me since i was born how did three young persons such as yourselves untrained in the art of war escape from harrenhal gendry a smith he was apprenticed in the armoury a smith eh where'd you train king landing tobho mott shop that criminal he charges twice as much as every other armourer in the city that because he twice as good ahha a smith and a salesman gendry stole us weapons ah you think lady stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank fought your way out of harrenhal i see he knows how to use a sword and so do i my brothers taught me ooh to your brothers you can finish your meals before you go it may be awhile before you see another you'll free us i gave you my word but before you go following her around for the rest of her life allow me to raise a cup to your hey hey now that is an uncommonly large person how does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person one waits for him to drink until he passes out poor man you have my sympathy aha not a man at all a hound so good to see you again clegane a week journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword thoros the fuck you doing here drinking and talking too much same as ever a pretty prize lads yeah girl what in seven hells are you doing with the stark bitch it a tough decision take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water silence if lady stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service anyone can see us on the bridge but cross by water and the current could take us or i could escape down the river good luck it wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas which will she choose gambler at heart wouldn't have guessed be quick about it oh i need to rest get up i have these on your feet when you walk too far i'm sure she'll let me know she an honest woman what do you call them get up now corns i never used to get corns i used to ride everywhere not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year this heel is ruined there no way i never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords ooh you move well for a great beast of a woman for all the good it done her you shouldn't grimace before you lunge it gives away the game bit of a quandary for you if you kill me you fail lady stark but if you don't kill me i'm going to kill you you're good graceless but good see if you were willing to hurt me you might have had me there looks like your woman getting the better of you if you can call that a woman we enjoy a good fight gets our juices flowing the flayed man of house bolton a bit gruesome for my taste how did you come into lady stark service you sure he the one that him all right i saw him fight at the tourney for ser willem frey wedding give the man his silver let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want enough to buy me a new head if the king in the north hears i let the kingslayer go he'll be taking it right off i'd rather he takes yours there something we can talk about not your concern kingslayer hodor it had to be recently you weren't with her at winterfell how would you know because i visited winterfell i would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways move were you pledged to stannis gods no ah renly really he wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12course meal shut your mouth why it all right hodor i lived with him at court since he was a boy don't forget could hardly escape the little tulip skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks i knew him better than you i knew him as well as anyone as a member of his kingsguard he trusted me with everything he would have been a wonderful king sounds like you quite fancied him i did not fancy him oh gods you did 0 game of thrones s03e03 walk of punishmant srt if i may nephew back to casterly rock with his tail between his legs i hope you're pleased if i were armed they'd never have taken us you were armed when we were taken i was in chains if you recall our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound all my life i've been hearing "jaime lannister "what a brilliant swordsman " you were slower than i expected and more predictable i've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year i'm a woman i was beating you i think king robb understands we won't win this war you were not beating me maybe you were as good as people said once or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name when we make camp tonight you'll be raped more than once none of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman you'd be wise not to resist would i they'll knock your teeth out you think i care no i don't think you care about your teeth if he the only one winning any battles if you fight them they will kill you do you understand i'm the prisoner of value not you let them have what they want what does it matter what does it matter close your eyes pretend they're renly if you were a woman you wouldn't resist you'd let them do what they wanted if i was a woman i'd make them kill me but i'm not thank the gods if i had a proper forge i'd make it good as new no there glory enough to go around doesn't have to look pretty it just has to keep the arrows out of my heart why are you helping him he takes us prisoner now he our friend you're not our prisoner what am i our guest no one put any chains on you so i can walk away then these woods aren't safe for ned stark daughter you're lucky we found you it not about glory you think you're good with that bow you little twat better than anyone you've met a coward weapon i like to fight up close i like to see a man face when i put the steel in

pie goodbye arry up you go little lady hey hot pie it really good a person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war it often comforts me to think that even in war darkest days in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening i've missed you uncle father missed you too from the day you left the mountain was garrisoned across the river from it maybe he never said it in so many words maybe your father was a stubborn old ox i was surprised when he died didn't think death had the patience i'm glad you were with him i wish to the gods i had been did you make peace in the end after 30 years of fighting i don't think he remembered what started it he asked me to stop calling myself blackfish he said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with i told him people had been calling me blackfish for so long is he there now they don't remember my real name every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign i'd see him off "wait for me little cat " he'd say "wait for me and i'll come back to you " and i would sit at this window every day when the sun came up waiting i wonder how many times did bran or rickon stare across the moors of winterfell waiting for me to return i encountered a situation with one of my lieutets of course not we took the fight to him he could not withstand us i will never see them again you mustn't think it we don't know the truth they could be in hiding robb believes they're alive and he must go on believing he got to remain strong if he to prevail and you must remain strong for him you're robb stark

khaleesi this man has been sentenced to death here drink leave this place your grace leave tonight i beg you and what is she to do for soldiers we can find sellswords in pentos and myr is it "we" already ser barristan if you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built you must win it that means blood on your hands before the thing is done do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father the blood of my enemies not the blood of innocents how many wars have you fought in ser barristan three have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands i was in king landing after the sack khaleesi you know what i saw butchery babies children old man more woman raped than you can count there a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand but the unsullied are not man they do not rape brother greatgrandsons they do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered if you buy them the only man they'll kill are those you want dead you disagree ser barristan when your brother led his army into battle at the trident man died for him because they believed in him because they loved him not because they'd been bought at an auction i fought beside the last dragon on that day i bled beside him rhaegar fought valiantly rhaegar fought nobly no and rhaegar died did you know him well ser barristan i did your grace finest man i ever met i wish i had known him but he was not the last dragon all did this one ears mishear your grace they did not i want to buy them all she wants to buy them all she can't afford them the slut thinks she can flash her tits and make us give her whatever she wants how many man did you lose there are 8 000 unsullied in astapor is this what you mean by all yes 8 000 and the ones still in training as well if they fail on the battlefield they will shame astapor master greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys if they fail on the battlefield they will bring shame upon all of astapor i will have them all or take none many will fall in battle i'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop 208 but for every man we lost the lannisters the slut cannot pay for all of this master kraznys says you cannot afford this her ship will buy her 100 unsullied no more your ship will buy you 100 unsullied and this because i like the curve of her ass because master kraznys is generous what is left will buy her 10 the gold you have left is worth 10 i will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering but good master kraznys will give you 20 we need our man more than tywin needs his her dothraki smell of shit the dothraki you have with you but may be useful as pig feed the dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed i will give her 3 for those but master kraznys will give you three unsullied for all of them so ask this beggar queen master kraznys asks how you propose to pay how will she pay for the remaining 7 877 why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill i'm sorry for the remaining 7 877 unsullied i have dragons i'll give you one you will win the throne with dragons not slaves your grace khaleesi please three dragons one two one they want the biggest one done done i didn't know i'll take you as well now you'll be master kraznys' gift to me a token of a bargain well struck she asks that you give me to her as a present she asks that you do this now khaleesi a dragon is worth more than any army aegon targaryen proved that you're both here to advise me i value your advice but if you ever question me in front of strangers again you would have you'll be advising someone else is that understood do you have a name this one name is missandei your grace do you have a family a mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice no your grace no family living you belong to me now it is your duty to tell me the truth yes your grace lying is a great offence many of those on the walk of punishmant were taken there for less right here today at this gathering if you had been patient i offered water to a slave dying on the walk of punishmant do you know what he said to me "let me die " there are no masters in the grave your grace is it true what master kraznys told me about the unsullied about their obedience all questions have been taken from them they obey that is all once they are yours they are yours they will fall on their swords if you command it and what about you you know that i'm taking you to war you may go hungry you may fall sick we seem to be running short of patience here you may be killed valar morghulis yes all man must die but we are not man a surprising place to keep the royal ledgers i'm surprised you're surprised this is the safest place in the city not for bastards that all of them my lord thank you my dear pod you know who isn't pod take them outside i'll be there in a momant yes my lord i hear you owe that boy a significant debt only my life not all that significant i'm afraid you should have him knighted if only the master of coin had such power if only i owe you a significant debt our redheaded friend tywin lannister you secured her release when the queen detained her oh that of course a simple misunderstanding apparently her grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship we don't i did fuck her once i know but we don't i know how'd the queen get that idea why don't you ask her intimate lovely table any advice for me on my new position keep a low profile if i had a gold dragon for every time i heard that joke i'd be richer than you are well you are richer than i am good point they're only numbers numbers on paper once you understand that it easy to make them behave trivial even you want a real challenge try whores i've tried quite a few well lots of work to do enjoy the eyrie better chairs than the old small council chamber come on i'm here later come on tonight then looks like dull reading you think all reading is dull reading it an opinion i share with some of the finest man i know the secret history of the seven kingdoms is in these pages unless lord twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he really up to unless he made it all up yes podrick do keep up conveniently close to your own quarters i like it yes my lord podrick yes my lord after a long consultation with my colleague ser bronn i finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable tell me pod have you ever been with a woman no my lord wonderful genna specialises in firsttimers and don't call him "nephew " he is your king what news of jaime she not bad with secondtimers either uh my lord a fair enough repaymant for putting your spear through my wouldbe killer face wouldn't you say now as it happens marei is quite the spearhandler herself she here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me he handsome 20 000 unwashed northerners have known about his escape for weeks you didn't tell me he was handsome kayla is famous from here to volantis in certain circles one of four woman in the world who can perform a proper meereenese knot my lord i don't even she here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who never once failed to address me as "my lord " be back in time for my supper pace yourself lad for years i've heard that littlefinger is a magician whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together you control more spies and informants and poof mountains of gold let me guess he not a magician no he stealing it worse he borrowing it what wrong with that we can't afford to pay it back that what wrong with it the crown owes millions to my father seeing as it his grandson ass on the throne i imagine he'll forgive that debt than the rest of the world combined forgive a debt my father for a man of the world you're strangely naive i've never borrowed money i'm not clear on the rules well the basic principle is i lend you money and after an agreed upon period of time you return it with interest what if i don't well you have to but what if i don't this is why i don't lend you money do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is anyway it not my father i'm worried about it the iron bank of braavos we owe them tens of millions if we fail to repay these loans the bank will fund our enemies one way or another they always get their gold back ah the return of the conquering hero does he have a little jaunt in his step the lad practically skipping you were gone a long time i trust you got your money worth we are trying my lord or should i say my money worth oh it was a gift podrick this is more than i give you in a year he a squire you don't pay him oh then it much more than i give you in a year they wouldn't take it my lord maybe they're trying to curry some favour with the new master of coin have you ever known a whore to turn down gold they were happy enough to take it when i gave it to them what did you tell them i didn't tell them anything try harder what did you do to them lots of things and they seemed to like these things yes my lord of course they did they're paid to seem to like it only they weren't paid what are you saying these ladies enjoyed him so much they gave him the time for free is that what you're telling us sit down podrick what do we have then we're going to need details copious details come on come on come on come on you know how we deal with runaways take off his pants no no no no no i'm gonna fuck you into the dirt no please no no no no don't no please no no robb stark and most of his bannerman are in riverrun you little bastard come my lord you're a long way from home and winter is coming i'll take the big bitch first when she good and wet you lot can finish

bitch from who cares where never been with a woman that big she brienne of tarth her father is lord selwyn tarth heard of tarth i'm gonna cut your throat they call it the sapphire isle do you know why robb knows i meant him no in stark absence roose bolton holds harrenhal every sapphire in westeros was mined on tarth sapphires are gemstones the blue ones i know what they are lord selwyn would pay his daughter weight in sapphires if she returned to him but only if she alive her honour unbesmirched bring her back here yes my lord get up which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal come on come on on your feet unbesmirched not defiled fancy word for a fancy man i hated to read as a child but my father forced me to study every morning before i could practise with sword or horse two hours every day holed up in the maester chambers i learned a lot of fancy words in practice not in name i bet you did your father he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back you'll be a rich man till the end of your days and your sons will be rich man and their sons after them lands titles you'll have them all the north can't win this war you're a smart man you understand that we have the numbers we have the gold aye you have both let him have it fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding hard to argue with that now that we're speaking together man to man i wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree i'm not asking to be freed from my constraints but if i could sleep lying down my back would thank you for it i'm not as young and resilient as i was once none of us are the name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble unchain ser jaime from the tree come on man suppose you'll be wanting something to eat i'm famished actually i think we've got a spare partridge on the fire well i do like partridge bring the bird over here and the carving knife will this work as a table my lord oh yes yes this will do on the stump the lord of harrenhal will make you think you're the smartest man there is that everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots my father and if you get in any trouble all you've got to do is say "my father" and that it all your troubles are gone don't have you got something to say careful you don't want to say the wrong thing you're nothing without your daddy and your daddy ain't here a worthy suitor for the widow arryn never forget that here this should help you remember for which i am extremely grateful to you my lord lady arryn and i have known each other since we were children she has always been positively predisposed toward me you're lucky i'm not your king a successful courtship would make lord baelish acting lord of the vale titles do seem to breed titles you'll leave for the eyrie as soon as possible and bring lysa arryn into the fold then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him far be it from me to hinder true love but lord baelish absence would present certain problems the royal wedding may end up being i wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag the most expensive event in living memory summer has ended hard days lie ahead not a good time to leave the crown fices unattended fully agreed which is why i'm naming you new master of coin master of coin it would appear to best suits your talents i'm quite good at spending money but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it my blunder sent tywin mad dog i have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge hear hear he lifted her high in the air he sniffed and roared and smelled her there she kicked and wailed the maid so fair but he licked the honey from her hair from there to here from here to there all black and brown and covered with hair he smelled that girl on the summer air the bear the bear and the maiden fair 0 game of thrones s03e04 and now his watch is ended srt how many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass if i die you won't be getting how'd that turn out for us he had no way of knowing we do now we know what out there craster been out here surviving so he your new protector now our good friend craster we're like the sons he never had mormont isn't gonna save you this lummox here isn't gonna save you when the walkers come calling craster will serve us up like so many pigs if we want to live oh enough we'll have to look out for ourselves you woke him i'm sorry he beautiful shh he beautiful does he have a name no are you going to give him one why here gilly you said to hold it for you until you came back here you're back i wanted you to have it i don't want your stupid thimble i want to save my baby life can you do that can you i don't have time for you i don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time you have to go after him how you know how can't say that i've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast brandon mother how many times have i told you no climbing mother i need to find it it here it calling me i want you to promise me no more climbing promise me promise me promise me mother mother promise me bran promise me is he very large stop no larger than usual apparently and yet they said that he was extraordinary the most extraordinary man they've ever had and they've had a lot of man we're talking about the same podrick the quiet boy in lord tyrion service seems a bit simple what did he do to them i don't know my lord the girls are usually quite descriptive so what did they say far enough they said it was hard to describe huh prodigies appear in the oddest of places and what did littlefinger say about this loss of income he was too preoccupied to notice he leaving for the eyrie soon i'm helping him prepare for his journey ah yes to pursue his enduring love of the lady arryn and the title that comes with her sad really do that again and i'll take your other hand is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa stark he hasn't spoken to her since the last time as far as i know hmm but i don't think he lost interest what makes you say so his shipboard inventory you can read rare for a woman in your profession former profession of course i'm missing something obvious you're about to point out come on you two featherbeds he bringing two featherbeds for the cabin who is important enough to littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides littlefinger could he be bringing one of his girls he not interested in them my lord how do you know because i'm one of his girls prodigies in odd places indeed rhaenyra targaryen was murdered oh lord tyrion come in come in by her brother or rather his dragon it ate her while her son watched what left of her is buried in the crypts right down there the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum which seats 700 comfortably there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else there aren't more than 700 people of any importance no the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats i hope we might speak in confidence over there in that urn the ashes of aerion targaryen aerion brightflame they called him he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon he was wrong and of course there the mad king killed by my uncle would you like to see where the last targaryens are buried are you sure lady margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre no it quite all right your grace i'd love to see their tombs really it like taking a walk through history depends if he had any practice oh always in confidence the tomb just up here this is so exciting you were married here your grace yes must seem like only yesterday hmm seems like a lifetime ago your husband was buried here as well no he wanted his remains returned to storm end such a tragedy a fairly predictable tragedy about the events of the blackwater hunting and drinking don't mix i should say not my son a hunter it helps him forget he never been within a mile of a real battle i seem to recall he laid siege to storm end for the better part of a year all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent i told him to stay out of robert rebellion he had no business fighting an actual warrior we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave but they do seem to yearn for it perhaps this is the wrong time we shower them with good sense and it slides right off like rain off a wing and yet the world belongs to them a ridiculous arrangemant to my mind the gods have seen fit to make it so my father didn't want them here he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the blackwater but the high septon convinced him otherwise i'm glad he did i'm sorry your grace oh no it a wonderful time i know they did terrible things at the end but their ancestors built this sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness i couldn't agree more shall we go and see them if you give them your love they will return it a thousand fold i've spoken with them i know how they feel about you you led the defence of king landing they adore you open the doors i thought one of your little birds might joffrey wait lady margaery lady margaery bless you lady margaery lady margaery lady margaery margaery long live lady margaery king joffrey king joffrey have knowledge of my sister intentions to king joffrey king joffrey king joffrey gods bless king joffrey how far is it to deepwood motte not far my lord your sister is waiting for you there she sent you to save me yes i served them the man who were torturing you i did what they told and waited end your life why would you risk your life for me i grew up on saltcliffe my lord i was only a boy when they took you away my father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off i remember the look on my father face when he told us "that balon greyjoy last living son " and those are the words i heard over again when i saw what they were doing to you those man they said my father knew what they were doing to me i didn't inherit littlefinger spies did he i don't know my lord they they never told me much my sister man are loyal to her we don't need to hide from them not all those are your sister man some of them are loyal to your father hmm what is it i was just thinking how jealous i was when my father told yara to take this place along with his position i'm afraid what did he tell you to do raid fishing villages he didn't trust me thought i was a stark i could never be a stark robb stark always reminded me of that he lorded it over you didn't have to all he had to do was be be who he was born to be his life fit him better than his clothes which is why i'm coming to you i need proof how could someone like that ever be a brother to me he the king in the north and me my father gave me a choice and i made it i could never be a stark but ironborn that what i was born to be i paid the iron price for winterfell i murdered those boys the stark boys never found them that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for proof will there be a trial just some poor orphans living with a farmer i let dagmer slit their throats and i let him burn the bodies so i could keep winterfell and make my father proud maybe it not too late it is my real father lost his head at king landing i made a choice and i chose wrong and now i've burned everything down i need to know not everything my lord she up here yara shh wait i brought him back he he killed the others what no i didn't you can't no please stop no put him back where he belongs i have no proof only whispers eat what are you doing i'm dying you can't die you need to live to take revenge i don't care about revenge you coward a little misfortune and you're giving up misfor misfortune before all this nastiness you lost your hand my sword hand i was that hand you have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit you sound like a bloody woman i know what you did for me you told them tarth was full of sapphires it called the sapphire isle because of the blue of its water i was going to tell you the story of how i was cut you knew that why did you help me you wanted to speak to me yes about jaime what about him i wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back when catelyn stark took tyrion prisoner what did i do in response you started a war do you want to hear it still and if i would start a war for that lecherous little stump what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir whatever you can whatever i can you're still here yes why did it ever occur to you that i might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust i don't know do i not your sons not jaime or tyrion but me years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture really just with tiny tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them living by them that she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children all right contribute the tyrells are a problem as a boy i travelled with a troupe of actors through the free cities the tyrells helped us defeat stannis baratheon the tyrells saved your life your children lives margaery has her claws in joffrey she knows how to manipulate him good i wish you knew how to manipulate him i don't distrust you because you're a woman i distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are you've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes one day in myr i will do you like it a another golden rose how original i eat from plates stamped with roses i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring dear "growing strong " ha the dullest words of any house a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse "winter is coming" now that memorable "we do not sow " strong strong those are houses you watch out for direwolves and krakens fierce beasts but a golden rose growing strong that strikes fear in the heart look little loves a spider in the garden run along now grow strong my lady she loosened you up for us i feared the man meant to use me i wanted to personally welcome you to king landing the city has been made brighter by your presence the city is made brighter by my presence is that your usual line lord varys are you here to seduce me a little obvious perhaps oh no please seduce away it been so long though i rather think it all for naught what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit a question for the philosophers but you've come mincing all this way for something as i'd heard some man used small boys so might i sit no come i've heard you're such a clever man i'm curious why you've sought me out you've taken an interest in sansa stark have i because i spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you why shouldn't i she an interesting girl is she no not particularly but what he wanted was far worse but she had an interesting childhood she has sadly well forgive me for wasting your time then i thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing come come you surrender rather easily walk with me i know the walls have ears but apparently the shrubbery does too i choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still which is sansa stark neither a babe in the woods he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak i admired her father yes ned stark had many admirers and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head i could not help lord stark perhaps i can help his daughter how you're not the only one who has taken an interest in her that hardly surprising she a beautiful girl with a famous name indeed she'd make a lovely match for the right suitor it almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point yet did nothing to dull my senses littlefinger is not long for the capital a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes sansa stark goes with him and why have you come to me with this matter littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies he has acquired the first two how long before he has the army perhaps you'll laugh but i know him better than most and this is the truth littlefinger is one of the most dangerous man in westeros if robb stark falls sansa stark is the key to the north with a hooked blade he sliced me and if he marries her he'll have the key in his pocket which seems such a shame why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride you must despise him you're working so hard to undermine him actually i rather enjoy him but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes you are a clever man lord varys you are too kind i believe i have a possible solution root and stem chanting all the while one doesn't need to be clever for that it obvious isn't it i didn't mean to disturb you you haven't we'd like some privacy please if you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names i'll ask the king to speak with you himself what did you pray for i can't tell you why not he burned my parts in a brazier i'll tell you what i prayed for in the sept this morning let see for my family health and happiness for an end to the war for a short winter boring and traditional i'm afraid and you i'm sorry i just can't my cousin alanna was the most beautiful girl i'd ever seen when i was 12 i was all elbows and knees and alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me "pig face " she called me "pig face" that ridiculous the flames turned blue and i heard a voice answer his call it had something to do with my nose whenever she passed me in the halls she'd oink so i prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease a week after that she came down with porridge plague porridge plague oh you don't have it in the north your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony but that awful you're i still dream of that night i believed you porridge plague i'm an idiot don't say that no you're not so what happened to alanna oh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea it all terribly frustrating i'm sure she jealous of you now you'll be married here in the capital he going to fall not of the sorcerer not of his blade and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen i want us to be friends good friends that would make me very happy you must see highgarden you'd love it there i know you would we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon you should see the costumes people work on them for months uh i don't think the queen would let me leave king landing the queen regent you mean once i marry joffrey i'll be queen and if you were to marry loras i dream of the voice from the flames your place would be at highgarden wouldn't it we would be sisters you and i would you like that his name was bannen he was a good man a good ranger he came to us from where did he come from down white harbor way he came to us from white harbor never failed in his duty he kept his vows the best he could was it a god a demon a conjuror trick he rode far fought fiercely we shall never see his like again and now his watch has ended and now his watch has ended didn't think a broke foot could kill a man it wasn't his foot that killed him that bastard craster starved him to death craster got his daughters to feed you on his side we can't just show up and steal all his food i don't know we're brothers of the night watch not thieves the day we leave craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow he a bloody wildling never knew bannen could smell so good you have one son don't you mormont i had my 99th you ever meet a man with 99 sons and more daughters than i can count but the sorcerer called and a voice answered i'm glad for you are you now me i'll be glad when you and yours have gone as soon as our wounded are strong enough ah they're as strong as they're gonna get them that dying why don't you cut their throats and be done with it or leave them if you've not the stomach and i'll sort them myself whose throat you gonna cut old man and ever since that day i have hated magic and all those who practice it wait outside it cold outside and there nothing to eat my wives gave you bread there sawdust in the bread you don't like it you go out there and eat the snow i'd rather eat what you've got hidden away i told you to wait outside he sitting there drinking our wine eating his fill while we die i gave you crows enough i've got to feed my woman but you can see why i was eager to aid in your you admit you've got a hidden larder how else you make it through winter enough out i am a godly man you're a stingy bastard bastard out with you you little thief and you and you go sleep in the cold on empty bellies i'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard you are a bastard fight against

us were swineherds and some of us tanners and masons that was before you're still swineherds and tanners and masons he going to fall off his horse help him i feel the need for actual revenge against you think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier no fighting in a war makes you a soldier beric dondarrion you've seen better days and i won't see them again stark deserters baratheon deserters you lot aren't fighting in a war you're running from it last i heard you were king joffrey guard dog but here you are 1 000 miles from home which of us is running the actual person who tried to have me killed untie these ropes and we'll find out what are you doing leading a mob of peasants ned stark ordered me to execute your brother in king robert name ned stark is dead king robert is dead my brother alive you're fighting for ghosts that what we are ghosts waiting for you in the dark you can't see us but we see you no matter whose cloak you wear lannister stark baratheon which will require a degree of influence which you prey on the weak the brotherhood without banners will hunt you down you found god is that it aye i've been reborn in the light of the one true god as have we all as would any man who seen the things we've seen if you mean to murder me then get on with it you'll die soon enough dog but it won't be murder only justice you do not possess at the momant and a kinder fate than you deserve lions you call yourselves at the mummer ford girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched i wasn't at the mummer ford dump your dead children at some other door house clegane was built upon dead children i saw them lay prince aegon and princess rhaenys before the iron throne do you take me for my brother is being born clegane a crime murder is a crime i never touched the targaryen babes but influence is largely a matter of patience i have found i never saw them never smelt them never heard them bawling you want to cut my throat get on with it but don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not you murdered mycah the butcher boy my friend he was 12 years old he was unarmed and you rode him down you slung him over your horse like he was some deer aye he was a bleeder you don't deny killing this boy i was joffrey sworn shield once i had served the sorcerer purpose the boy attacked the prince that a lie i hit joffrey mycah just ran away then i should have killed you not my place to question princes you stand accused of murder but no one here knows the truth of the charge so it is not for us to judge you only the lord of light may do that now i sentence you to trial by combat so who will it be should we find out if your fire god really loves you priest he threw me out of his house to die or you archer what are you worth with a sword in your hand or is the little girl the bravest one here aye she might be but it me you'll fight the master says they are untested he says you would be wise to blood them early there are many small cities between here and there cities ripe for sacking should you take captives the masters will i resolved to live to spite him buy the healthy ones and for a good price and who knows in 10 years some of the boys you send them may be unsullied in their turn thus all shall prosper is it done then they belong to me it is done it is done she holds the whip you

any man who wishes to leave may leave and no one will harm him i give you my word will you fight for me as free man and soon learned that the contents of a man letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse step by step one distasteful task after another i made my way from the slums of myr to the small council chamber influence grows like a weed i tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the red keep all the way across to the far side of the world where i managed to wrap them around something very special water please water ugh the sorcerer hello my old friend it been a long time i have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it when people talk about the night watch they never mantion the shovelling or the shit they tell you about honour water water please please please pardoning crimes and protecting the realm but shovelling really is most of it and getting attacked or killed or worse and that but when you're not getting attacked or killed usually you're shovelling ah look more shit i was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day we need to get out of here when the lord commander says we go we go the lord commander told us to go to the fist of the first man 0 game of thrones s03e05 kissed by fire srt lord get back let not go back let stay here a while longer i don't ever want to leave this

lord cast your light upon this man your servant ser jaime isn't well take him to qyburn will i die no the corruption has spread i fear it must be cut away the safest course would be to take the whole arm off then you'll die you're no maester where your chain the citadel stripped me of it bring him back from death and darkness restore his flame they found some of my experimants too bold i can leave your upper arm make the cut at your elbow i don't need my right hand to kill you i can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine mmm with any luck that will suffice you'll need milk of the poppy no milk of the poppy there will be pain for the night is dark and full of terrors i'll scream quite a bit of pain i'll scream loudly lord baelish your grace i wonder if i might ask you for a favour of course your grace i believe that house tyrell don't hold the crown best interests at heart i see and have you shared these suspicions with lord tywin my father a practical man he appreciates facts lord cast arya don't myself i often find them a hindrance and he appreciates those who aid his family as you well know he almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't you have a good working relationship with the tyrells i thought you might look into it before you leave the capital i shall do my best thank you and your best will prove better than when i asked you to locate arya stark i assure you that it will bring him back from death and darkness gods boy that enough we're not in a tavern pardon my lady no need to speak are there any figs fetch some i always take figs midafternoon they help move the bowels to what do i owe this summons thank you for seeing me my lady i had hoped we might discuss a few ficial matters i climbed all those steps to discuss ficial matters it the royal wedding i'm told you had a hand in planning it naturally no let go of me let me go it shaping up to be a very involved affair the word "extravagant" has been used what good is the word "extravagant" if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding i understand that good but as master of coin it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown as of now it a huge expense and and we're at war lady olenna cast your light upon us looks like their god likes me more than your butcher boy oh i'd nearly forgotten and maintaining supply lines i can't think how it slipped my mind what is it 12 000 infantryman the tyrell family has supplied 1 800 mounted lances 2 000 in support provisions so this city might survive the winter a million bushels of wheat half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye 20 000 head of cattle 50 000 sheep you don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses burn in hell i'm quite familiar with them and we are grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm as is a royal wedding the people are hungry for more than just food they crave distractions and if we don't provide them they'll create their own and their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces a royal wedding is much safer wouldn't you say he will i would and traditionally paid for by the royal family i was told you were drunk impertinent and thoroughly debauched imagine my disappointmant at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper where did you go for them volantis my lady oh very well i won't have it said that house tyrell refuses to play its part we'll pay for half and the celebrations will go on as planned is that sufficient quite thank you but not today very good then that settled good day give me that what are you doing just manding lord beric armour why i'm going to stay and smith for the brotherhood have you lost your mind when the lannisters find this place you think they'll spare the smiths they'll cave your head in orell says there are crows patrolling on the wall they wanted to kill me long before i joined the brotherhood you don't have to i want to they need good man robb needs good man too we're leaving tomorrow and then you what serve him i've served man my entire life i served master mott at king landing and he sold me to the watch i served lord tywin at harrenhal wondering every day if i'd get tortured or killed tell me what you know i'm done serving you just said you were serving lord beric he may be their leader but they chose him these man are brothers they're a family i've never had a family i can be your family you wouldn't be my family you'd be "my lady " willem willem is this a rescue lannister filth take him there are four to a patrol two builders to check for structural damage please i didn't do anything i'm just a squire please bring them in is that all of them it took five of you to murder two unarmed squires not murder your grace vengeance vengeance those boys didn't kill your sons i saw harrion die on the battlefield and torrhen was strangled by the kingslayer two rangers to watch for enemies they were his kin they were boys look at them tell your mother to look at them she killed them as much as i my mother had nothing to do with this this was your treason it treason to free your enemies in war you kill your enemies did your father not teach you that boy leave him aye how often do these patrols go out leave me to the king he wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free that how he deals with treason our king in the north or should i call him the king who lost the north escort lord karstark to the dungeon hang the rest mercy i didn't kill anyone i only watched for the guards this one was only the watcher hang him last so he can watch the others die please please no they made me do it they made me they made me it varies word of this can't leave riverrun they were tywin lannister nephews the lannisters pay their debts they never stop talking about it would you make me a liar as well it wouldn't be lying we will bury them and remain silent until the war is done i'm not fighting for justice if i don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks no matter how highborn lord of light defend us if i knew where on the wall we were heading i could tell you he has to die the karstarks are northman they won't forgive the killing of their lord your mother right if you do this the karstarks will abandon you you tended to their wounds you brought them supper now they're dead and more boys will keep dying until this war is over you need karstark man to end it spare his life keep him as a hostage a hostage tell the karstarks that as long as they're loyal he will not be harmed you'd like to know that the blood of the first man flows through my veins as much as yours boy i fought the mad king for your father i fought joffrey for you we are kin stark and karstark that didn't stop you from betraying me and it won't save you now i don't want it to save me i want it to haunt you to the end of your days kneel my lord rickard karstark lord of karhold here in sight of gods and man i sentence you to die there are 19 castles guarding the wall would you speak a final word kill me and be cursed you are no king of mine joffrey cersei ilyn payne

altogether so why don't you we need the gold three do i frighten you child no you're angry with me and i don't blame you but letting him go was the right thing i have more reason to want him hanged i thought he killed you he did but how thoros how many times have you brought me back it the lord of light who brings you back you sure of that i'm just the lucky drunk who says the words how many times five i think no this makes six six there was the first time the mountain show her lance right through the chest then i was stabbed in the belly then it was an arrow in the back which three and that axe in the side then the lannisters caught me and executed me for treason was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye both fuckers couldn't decide and the hound makes six second time i've been killed by a clegane you'd think you'd learn it not getting any easier you know i know every time i come back castle black i'm a bit less pieces of you get chipped away could you bring back a man without a head not six times just once i don't think it works that way child he was a good man ned stark he at rest now somewhere i would never wish my life upon him i would you're alive lord cast your light upon me aye castle black protect me in the darkness burn away my sins help me serve you use me as you will for the night is dark and full of terrors i have prayed day and night for you to come to me my lady i

said you fought in a battle did you win no did the onion knight come back with you he did he fought bravely he hasn't come to visit me he said he'd bring me back a present from the capital he won't be visiting child why not he my friend what happens to your eagle after i kill you look he made this for me but don't tell mother i have it it a secret mother doesn't like the onion knight ser davos is a traitor he rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime best forget him not so hard you'll scrub the skin off what are you doing here i need a bath does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut help me out of these rags now get out there another tub this one suits me fine don't worry i'm not interested if i faint pull me out i don't intend to be the first lannister to die in a bathtub why should i care how you die you swore a solemn vow remember you're supposed to get me to king landing in one piece or does he just flop dead to the ground not going so well is it no wonder renly died with you guarding him that was unworthy forgive me you protected me better than most don't you mock me i'm apologising i'm sick of fighting let call a truce you need trust to have a truce i trust you there it is there the look i've seen it for 17 years on face after face he no crow you all despise me kingslayer oathbreaker a man without honour you've heard of wildfire of course the mad king was obsessed with it he loved to watch people burn the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones he burned lords he didn't like he burned hands who disobeyed him just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us he burned anyone who was against him before long half the country was against him aerys saw traitors everywhere so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city beneath the sept of baelor and the slums of flea bottom under houses stables taverns even beneath the red keep itself finally the day of reckoning came robert baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the trident i'm not afraid of you but my father arrived first with the whole lannister army at his back promising to defend the city against the rebels i knew my father better than that he never been one to pick the losing side i told the mad king as much i urged him to surrender peacefully but the king didn't listen to me he didn't listen to varys who tried to warn him but he did listen to grand maester pycelle that grey sunken cunt strike this man down if he is guilty i like you boy "you can trust the lannisters " he said "the lannisters have always been true friends of the crown " so we opened the gates and my father sacked the city once again i came to the king begging him to surrender he told me to bring him my father head then he turned to his pyromancer "burn them all " he said "burn them in their homes burn them in their beds " tell me if your precious renly commanded you to kill your own father but if you lie to me i'll pull your guts out through your throat and stand by while thousands of man woman and children burned alive would you have done it would you have kept your oath then first i killed the pyromancer and then when the king turned to flee i drove my sword into his back "burn them all " he kept saying "burn them all " i don't think he expected to die he meant to burn with the rest of us a thousand man and rise again reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash i slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen that where ned stark found me if this is true why didn't you tell anyone why didn't you tell lord stark stark you think the honourable ned stark wanted to hear my side we'll find out soon enough he judged me guilty the momant he set eyes on me by what right does the wolf judge the lion by what right help help the kingslayer jaime my name is jaime onion knight ser onion knight princess gods what are you doing here shh you'll wake bert bert he the fat one he on guard duty tonight i don't need you to protect me he likes to drink wine and sleep a lot go back to your room you're not supposed to be here if your father knew he said you were a traitor are you i am child i disobeyed my king your father and now i'm paying the price i don't care you're my friend you must get bored down here i brought you something to read it about aegon and his dragons aegon used to live here did you know that of course you do and the targaryens built this castle aye so they did you can hide the book under your cloak it a good one i'll bring you more thank you my lady i'm sure it a fine book but it wasted on me take it i have more my lady i can't read the words you can't i'll teach you i'll come when bert on duty and teach you who stopped rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat no no no it easy it'll be fun go we can't why not what will they do lock us in cells i wouldn't know where to start at the beginning this word is "aegon " when you see "a " "e " and "g" together like that it sounds like "egg " and the title of the whole book is an history of aegon the conqueror and his conquest of westeros it was a bitch of a siege mmm who vouched for you with mance you were first through the breach at pyke the second thoros of myr went in alone waving that flaming sword of his thoros of myr bloody madman robert knighted you after the battle proudest momant of my life one knee in the dust the king sword on my shoulder listening to the words "in the name of the warrior i charge you to be brave " all i could think of was how badly i had to piss it seems you owe me a debt in full plate metal for 16 hours never occurred to me till the fighting was over i was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king boots robert would have laughed he was a good man a great warrior and a terrible king i burned away my years fighting for terrible kings you swore an oath yes and a man of honour keeps his vows give it back even if he serving a drunk or a lunatic just once in my life before it over i want to know what it like to serve with pride to fight for someone i believe in do you believe in her with all my heart these are the ones yes khaleesi the officers you did not choose this life but you are free man now and free man make their own choices give strength to his sword if he is true well i stole it have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks remove your helmet this one has the honour what is your name grey worm grey worm all unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut grey worm red flea black rat names that remind them what they are vermin it mine if you want it come steal it back from this day forward you will choose your own names you will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same throw away your slave name choose the name your parents gave you or any other a name that gives you pride "grey worm" gives me pride it is a lucky name the name this one was born with was cursed that was the name he had when he was taken as a slave but grey worm is the name this one had the day daenerys stormborn set him free ygritte king robert wanted her dead of course he wanted her dead she a targaryen the last targaryen i suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him i didn't sit on the small council no doesn't the lord commander of the kingsguard traditionally traditionally yes but i killed a dozen of robert friends during his rebellion he didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the mad king ygritte can't say i minded much i always hated the politics yeah i imagine i would too hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over mmmhmm still she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms she'll have good man around her to advise her man with experience which man do you have in mind ygritte seven hells forgive me for what i'm about to say but your reputation in westeros has suffered over the years it suffered for a reason i sold man into slavery i don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home our cause forgive me ser barristan but i was busy defending the khaleesi against king robert assassins while you were still bowing to the man we both want her to rule am i wrong ygritte you only joined us a few days ago i can't speak to your intentions if we're truly her loyal servants we will do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride you're not lord commander here you're just another exile and i take my orders from the queen come to bed you were right the karstarks are gone is orell right are you still a crow almost half our forces tywin lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel nothing only wait don't let him what can i do attack king landing there nothing he'd like better he'd crush us in a day we could ride north take your land back from the greyjoys wait out the winter winter could last five years it time you proved yourself once my bannerman are home again sitting by the fire surrounded by their families warm and safe they'll never ride south again when i gathered my lords together we had a purpose a mission now we're like a band of bickering children give them a new purpose what i don't know i don't even know where winterfell is here and we're here ygritte king landing what is it i can't force them to meet us in the field and i can't attack them where they're strongest but i can attack them where they're not and casterly rock can't run away i'm going to take their home away from them can you do it i need man to replace the karstarks who marched home there is only one person in this kingdom you swore some vows with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the lannisters the man whose daughter i was supposed to marry walder frey he such a splendid fighter do you have any idea when we might i'll plant the seed as soon as joffrey and i are married it should grow quickly joffrey won't let me leave he got too many reasons to keep me here and only one to let you go because it will please me lord of light give us wisdom i want you to break 'em squire well fought ser that was no fight i don't know you olyver if it please you i should like to see you spar with a proper partner ser how did you know know what that i wanted to my lord i want you to see me i'll have you know i'm to be married soon

knight of flowers is engaged to be wed is he and all of me who the lucky girl she may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest but she mine i've always wanted a ship now i want a dozen strange isn't it what is it doesn't matter what we want once we get it then we want something else your hair is different we shouldn't is it lady margaery wears it that way many ladies wear it this way i have good news i'll be leaving the city soon you still want me to come with you it not a question of what i want it what you want you want to go home don't you of course more than anything but maybe it would be better to wait i've been thinking how dangerous it would be not just for me but for you we should you've been so kind i'd feel terrible if anything happened to you i can't tell you how touched i am by your concern for my welfare i hope you know that i'm your friend sansa your true friend i do lord baelish petyr petyr if you wish to stay then of course you will stay we'll speak

olenna tyrell i've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding never mind that now we have something important to discuss i'm master of coin saving money is important stop that you're making me uncomfortable that thing you did with your mouth your sister has learned that your new friends the tyrells are plotting to marry sansa stark to ser loras very well she a lovely girl missing some of loras' favourite bits but i'm sure they'll make do your jokes are not appreciated it wasn't my best but i bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me by trying to steal the key to the north out from under me sansa is the key to the north i seem to remember she has an older brother the karstarks have marched home is that what lords do to their ladies in the south the young wolf has lost half his army his days are numbered theon greyjoy murdered both his brothers that makes sansa stark the heir to winterfell and i am not about to hand her over to the tyrells the tyrell army is helping us to win this war do you really think it wise to refuse them there nothing to refuse this is a plot plots are not public knowledge and the tyrells won't carry this one out until after joffrey wedding we need to act first and kill this union in its crib i don't know i just wanted to kiss you there is all and how do we do that we find sansa stark a different husband wonderful yes it is you can't mean it i can and i do joffrey made this poor girl life miserable since the day he took her father head now she finally free of him and you give her to me that cruel even for you hmm do you intend on mistreating her the girl happiness is not my concern nor yours she a child she flowered i assure you she and i have discussed it at length there you see you will wed her bed her and put a child in her surely you're capable of that and if i refuse you wanted to be rewarded for your valour in battle sansa stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for for the night is dark and full of terrors you seemed to like it and it is past time you were wed i was wed or don't you remember only too well you should be thanking the gods for this this is more than you deserve tyrion will

me bigger you should not have this power i have no power i ask the lord for his favour and he responds as he will i've always been a terrible priest drank too much rum fucked all the whores in king landing it a terrible thing to say but by the time i came to westeros i didn't believe in our lord i decided that he that all the gods but the more wood the bigger the fire so big you can't even see the top sometimes were stories we told the children to make them behave so i wore the robes and every now and then i'd recite the prayers but it was just for show a spectacle for the locals until the mountain drove a lance through this one heart i knelt beside his cold body and said the old words not because i believed in them but he was my friend and he was dead and they were the only words i knew and for the first time in my life the lord replied it hidden in clouds beric eyes opened and i knew the truth our god is the one true god and all man must serve him you've been to the other side

tell you by the old gods and the new i swear it you win the game if you can figure out who i am and why i'm torturing you and i win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger if i win you'll let me go if you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention please very tasty you say "please" again and you'll wish you hadn't you first where are we the north too vague deepwood motte terrible guess now where last hearth do i look like a fucking umber to you karhold it needs to breathe sometimes one of the brothers will sing karhold how did you know that did you see any banners flying when we came in no it was just a guess very good lord theon and who am i torrhen karstark he dead strangled by the kingslayer dareon sings best he was your brother your father is lord rickard karstark you swore to tell me if i you're right lord rickard karstark is robb stark bannerman i betrayed robb that why you're torturing me yes you win of course you forgot to ask one question do you sing no you forgot to ask if i'm a liar i'm afraid i am everything i told you is a lie this isn't happening to you for a reason but well one reason i enjoy it please cut it off cut it off cut it off i win thank you for riding here so quickly i know travel isn't easy in these times no no no not very well the roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits when the king of the north summons us we come our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met lord frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters of course he deserves as much i was in the wrong as restitution for this betrayal he demands harrenhal and all its attendant lands i don't think that sing me a song we are fighting for the north harrenhal is not in the north it is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it and there something else we will do whatever we can to give lord frey what he needs not what whom what uh no our father requires lord edmure to wed one of his daughters roslin how old is she oh all right let see nineteen could i see her first you want to count her teeth we depart for the twins in the morning we need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end your father does realise we're in the middle of a war father is old it will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband oh and his recent experience has made him wary of long engagemants he has every right to be please excuse us while we discuss it why should i let that old ferret choose my bride for me at the very least i should be offered the same choice you were i'm his liege lord he a proud man and we've wounded him i didn't wound him my answer is no listen to me and listen very carefully you the laws of gods and man are very clear the father face is stern and strong no man can compel another man to marry the laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth it all right you heard him if you refuse our alliance with the freys is dead he wanted me for one of his daughters since i was 12 he not gonna stop wanting it now when i say no he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing you're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife he sits and judges right from wrong i have a war to fight we can't win it without them i have no time to haggle you said you wanted to make amands for the stone mill you recall that heroic engagemant i had something less permanent in mind i've won every battle but i'm losing this war if we don't do this and do it now we're lost i'll marry her you're paying for my sins uncle it not fair or right i'll remember it he weighs our lives the short and long i see my man have finally found you something appropriate to wear yes most kind of them you're a stark bannerman lord bolton i am acting on lady stark orders to return jaime lannister to king landing when king robb left harrenhal his mother was his prisoner if she wasn't his mother he'd have hanged her for treason i should send you back to robb stark you should but instead you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner take off that big log and loves the little children why might that be wars cost money many people would pay a great deal for you we both know who would pay the most or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution you're right perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies it would be if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it king robb is keeping your father quite busy the mother gives the gift of life he doesn't have time for anything else he'll make time for you as soon as you're well enough to travel i will allow you to go to king landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made and you will swear to tell your father the truth that i had nothing to do with your maiming shall we drink on it i don't partake you do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people and watches over every wife very well my lady may our journey continue without further incident oh she won't be going with you i am charged with bringing ser jaime to you are charged with abetting treason i'm afraid i must insist you're in no place to insist on anything i would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position impossible why her gentle smile ends all strife my grandson is the pride of highgarden the most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms your daughter is rich the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king old old old i'm something of an expert on the subject her change will be upon her before long and she loves her little children i'll spare you the details of what will happen then you may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter but this is another matter entirely the years punish us as well i promise you that my stomach remains quite strong however the only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson nocturnal activities do you deny them oh not at all a swordswallower through and through that not how you skin a rabbit a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name did you grow up with boy cousins lord tywin sons of your father bannerman squires stable boys of course and you never no not once not in any way never i know how to skin a rabbit i congratulate you upon your restraint but it natural boys having a go beneath the sheets perhaps highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behaviour i wouldn't say that true we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery but brothers and sisters where i come from that stain would be very difficult to wash out i will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it not by the looks of it lie or not you must admit many people find it quite convincing convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill lannisters and tyrells thanks to our new affiliation i don't care what people believe and neither do you as an authority on myself i must disagree now if the rumours about my children were true then joffrey is no king at all you grow up north of the wall and house tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt and if cersei is too old to give loras children we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt it is a chance we simply cannot take the uncertainty makes you uncomfortable all right i'll remove it for you if you refuse to marry loras to cersei i will name him to the kingsguard i'm sure you're familiar with the kingsguard vows you learn the proper way to handle game he will never marry he will never have children ah the tyrell name will fade and highgarden will go to the children of joffrey and margaery you would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you i would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously so shall i draw up the order or do you consent to this match it a rare enough thing a man who lives up to his reputation ah i didn't see any game before i got here no we've gotta cut them loose no take my hand that a wonderful pin it more of a brooch really though i suppose a brooch is a sort of pin so i'm very happy about yes i am as well i feel like i'm in a dream if i had a bow i could have shot a dozen yes me too definitely i've dreamed of a large wedding since i was young the guests the food the tournamants and the bride of course the most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves have you ever been to highgarden my lady no i had never left winterfell before i came to king landing but it sounds wonderful i can't wait to see it well i made this bow myself and to leave this place it terrible isn't it the most terrible place there is i don't suppose there anything we can do about this we can have them both killed it hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangemant probably sansa though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery father doesn't discriminate guess you don't learn how to do that north of the wall we're all being shipped off to hell together on a boat you built the tyrells were plotting to undermine our family i did what i did to protect our family i'm your family a member of your family who has actively contributed to that family survival whether or not you or father or anyone else wants to admit it i do admit it if it weren't for your trick with the wildfire you learn how to use your fists stannis would have sacked the city before father got here our heads would still be rotting on the city gate trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you there are two people in king landing who can give an order to a kingsguard did you or did you not order ser mandon to kill me during the battle of the blackwater the impulse i understand he hates me because i'm the only one who tells him what he really is oh you're gonna punch the rabbits to death so fair enough he wants me dead but his stupidity he could have had me poisoned and no one would have known but the king orders a kingsguard to murder the hand of the king in full view of his own army the boy an idiot what do you want me to say i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger probably but not from joffrey he won't do anything now father here seven kingdoms united in fear of tywin lannister i had someone else in mind not the tyrells soon they won't need to be afraid of him joffrey will belong to margaery the little doeeyed whore and so will his children and their children history will be taken from our hands you may escape at least once jaime gets back ser loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels when jaime gets back yes but when will that be he out there somewhere well someone else is sitting right here jaime or not i'm truly fucked who going to tell her do you think people will like it i don't think they will even notice it you're right it not my wedding anyway from what i can tell the dressmakers in highgarden will be far superior to the ones in king landing they'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding loras likes green and gold brocade you're both very good at skinning rabbits i'm sure he does will they let me invite my family they haven't asked my opinion but do you think they will no lady sansa lord tyrion to see you should i i beg your pardon my lady good afternoon lord tyrion i was trying on a gown for joffrey wedding yes it should be quite a wedding some of us are just a little better i need to speak with you lady sansa of course alone if i may why do you need to speak to her alone shae please excuse her she not from here but i trust her even though she tells me not to sometimes we think we want to hear something and it only afterwards when it too late that we realise we wished we'd heard it you know your fires well some of us would say thank you under entirely different circumstances it all right really how to begin it this this this is awkward a thousand blades taken from the hands of aegon fallen enemies forged in the fiery breath of balerion the dread there aren't 1 000 blades there aren't even 200 when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them i've counted i'm sure you have ugly old thing yet it has a certain appeal the lysa arryn of chairs shame you had to settle for your second choice early days my friend it is flattering really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what i want thwarting you has never been my primary ambition i promise you or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the wall although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then you're so right for instance when i thwarted your plan to give sansa stark to the tyrells if i'm going to be honest i did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoymant there but your confidant the one who fed you information about my plans the one you swore to protect you've got a big mouth girl and too many teeth you didn't bring her any enjoymant and she didn't bring me any enjoymant she was a bad investmant on my part luckily i have a friend who wanted to try something new something daring and he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience i did what i did for the good of the realm the realm do you know what the realm is it the 1 000 blades of aegon enemies stop it hmm a story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it a lie but what do we have left once we abandon the lie chaos a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all chaos isn't a pit chaos is a ladder many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again the fall breaks them and some are given a chance to climb but they refuse they cling to the realm or the gods or love hodor you've been fighting since you met illusions only the ladder is real the climb is all there is just stop it lady reed here got a stick so far up her ass it a wonder her feet touch the ground you've been nasty to her every day of course she nasty back someone built your fires for you growing up me it my fault first time i met her she put a knife to my throat first time i met you you held a knife at me we can't fight each other we'll never make it to the wall i want you both to make peace your way of skinning rabbits is quicker i said so didn't i osha you're a good little hunter thank you see not so hard is it it doesn't get so cold down in the reach thank you don't push me i'm right here with you what happening i'm right here with you what wrong with him the visions take their toll he having one now i saw jon snow you saw him at castle black he was on the wrong side of the wall and there were servants of course surrounded by enemies used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the wall crows would come out every morning with axes your flock gets smaller every year you ever climbed it before no but tormund done it half a hundred times you're afraid aren't you aye 0 game of thrones s03e07 the bear and the maiden fair srt how far are we how do the man holding the banners fight and

him 'cause he pretty is that it you like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes you think pretty is gonna make you happy don't touch me it a great honour to carry your house sigil you won't love him so much when you find out what he really is growing up at winterfell all i ever wanted was to escape to come here to the capital see the southern knights and their painted armour and king landing after dark all the candles burning in all those windows i'm stupid a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns come on and the drummers is that a great honour too come walk with me i remember

good thing it can be we're very complicated you know pleasing us takes practice how how do you know all this did your mother teach you yes sweet girl my mother taught me she a child she a foot taller

have to do is get a son in the stark girl he'll be lord of winterfell one day it the rhythm you can rule the north in his name you'll have two woman and a whole kingdom of your own two woman to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them you waste time trying to get people to love you you'll end up the most popular dead man in town you want to fuck that stark girl you just don't want to admit it i don't pay you to put evil notions in my head the ones already there don't need company you pay me to kill people who bother you about a week i think oh you mean right foot left foot evil notions come free your grace grandfather you wanted to speak to me yes i'd like a report on the meetings of my small council you're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council your grace any or all of them i've been very busy right foot left foot right foot many important matters require a king attention of course you've been holding the council meetings in the tower of the hand instead of the small council chamber i have yes may i ask why well the tower of the hand is where i work to walk from there to here would take time time i could otherwise spend productively so if i wanted to attend a council meeting what you need help remembering that i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand we could arrange to have you carried tell me about the targaryen girl in the east and her dragons where did you hear about this is it true apparently so don't you think we ought to do something about it when i was hand of the king under your father predecessor the skulls of all the targaryen dragons were kept in this room the skull of the last of them was right here when mance gives the signal and we hit castle black it was the size of an apple and the biggest was the size of a carriage yes and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us but how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counselling the king on matters about which he knows nothing but i haven't been counselled we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming you are being counselled at this very momant i should be consulted about such things from now on i will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary your grace yunkai the yellow city the yunkish train bed slaves not soldiers we can defeat them on the field with ease but they won't meet us on the field they have provisions patience and strong walls no if they're wise they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us man by man i don't want half my army killed before i've crossed the narrow sea we don't need yunkai khaleesi taking this city will not bring you any closer to westeros or the iron throne how many slaves are there in yunkai 200 000 if not more then we have 200 000 reasons to take the city no you're just gonna light the biggest fire send a man to the city gates tell the slavers i will receive them here and accept their surrender otherwise yunkai will suffer the same fate as astapor now comes the noble razdal mo eraz of that ancient and honourable house master of man and speaker to savages to offer terms of peace noble lord you are in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen queen of the andals and the first man khaleesi of the great grass sea the north has ever seen to let them know you're coming breaker of chains and mother of dragons you may approach sit will the noble lord take refreshmant ancient and glorious is yunkai our empire was old before dragons stirred in old valyria many an army has broken against our walls you shall find no easy conquest here khaleesi good my unsullied need practice i was told to blood them early if blood is your desire blood shall flow you know nothing jon snow but why 'tis true you have committed savageries in astapor but the yunkai are a forgiving and generous people the wise masters of yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen there is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship my ship yes khaleesi as i said we are a generous people you shall have as many ships as you require and what do you ask in return all we ask is that you make use of these ships she right you don't sail them back to westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace i have a gift for you as well your life my life and the lives of your wise masters but i also want something in return you will release every slave in yunkai every man woman and child shall be given as much food clothing and property as they can carry you think i know you cut me loose on the wall as paymant for their years of servitude reject this gift and i shall show you no mercy you are mad we are not astapor or qarth we are yunkai and we have powerful friends friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you those who survive we shall enslave once more perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well you swore me safe conduct i did but my dragons made no promises and you threatened their mother cut her loose too do you see her sulking about it take the gold my gold you gave it to me remember and i shall put it to good use you'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you now get out the yunkish are a proud people they will not bend and what happens to things that don't bend he said he had powerful friends who was he talking about i don't know find out that because she understands the way things are chains solid gold from the mines outside lannisport smithed in casterly rock golden chains you could buy a ship with these do i need a ship what am i going somewhere

doesn't mean that this is duty not desire is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her i don't have a choice my father does not rule the world we can still go across the narrow sea what would i do there juggle i am a lannister of casterly rock the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird and i'm shae the funny whore my feelings for you have not changed i will marry sansa stark and

the north knows it we grow up learning it he getting the wedding he wanted where the battles were fought the heroes who died where six times you've invaded and six times you've failed the seventh will be the same mance is different you don't have the discipline you don't have the training your army is no army you don't know how to fight together you don't know that i do i know it he getting a wedding if you attack the wall you'll die all of you all of us you're mine as i'm yours and if we die we die but first we'll live yes first we'll live what he going on about and how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work hodor that where we are what are you telling him it was a king he wanted it all right osha it not all right you think i can't hear you every day filling his head with black magic talking about visions and threeeyed ravens and worse leave him alone he can speak for himself i don't fill his head with anything so what do you talk about what happening to him and what that means go on then tell us what it means edmure is the best match a frey has had in the history of their house it not like that i wish i could tell him all the answers it would be much easier i don't want you talking to him any more until we get to your brother at castle black we're not going to castle black what did you say i told you already jon snow isn't there bran needs to find the raven beyond the wall oh no i'm not going back there your brother is at castle black that where we're going we should all get some sleep look at me the raven been coming to me ever since i fell

i belong in the north what if i fell from that tower for a reason is that what he telling you that it all for a reason if you don't put some clothes on all these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you i wish it were true little lord but the gods wouldn't spare a raven cold shit for you or me or anyone you don't understand you don't know you don't know none of you know none of you have been up there i had a man once a good man bruni his name was i was his and he was mine but one night bruni disappears people said he left me but i knew him you and your roads i can't promise i won't attack you again he'd never leave me not for long i knew he'd come back and he did he came in through the back of the hut only it wasn't bruni not really his skin was pale like a dead man his eyes bluer than clear sky he came at me grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard i could feel the life slipping out of me i don't know how i got the knife attack attack when i did i stuck it deep into his heart and he hardly seemed to notice i had to burn our hut down with him inside i didn't ask the gods what it meant i didn't need to i already knew it meant the north was no place for man to be not any more i promised your maester i'd get you to castle black and no further how is the pain my lord what the purpose of an arm with no hand well we've stymied the corruption who are you writing

why did the citadel take your chain did you fondle one boy too many no my lord that not my weakness what is my mother curiosity the only way to treat disease is to understand disease and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted you performed experimants on living man on dying man with their permission my studies have given me insight that has saved many lives dying paupers i assume

have taken her every which way because you knew i'd counsel restraint you came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself you're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory when my son was five he said to me "i don't ever want to die " i wanted to say to him "you won't child you won't ever " i hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark afraid i think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night i saw a vision in the flames kill me and you're free and left her there with her throat cut open a great battle in the snow i saw it and you saw whatever she gave birth to i never believed but when you see the truth when it right there in front of you as real as these iron bars how can you deny her god is real that dragon bitch

the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you you'll die young what do we do about the dragon girl we can't beat 8 000 unsullied on the battlefield there won't be a battle and we don't have to deal with her eunuchs we only have to deal with her she wellguarded tonight a new moon one of us slips into her camp past her unsullied and her knights where do you think i'm taking you which one of us close your eyes love three coins a coin from meereen a coin from volantis and a coin from braavos the braavosi does the deed one for each of us darling no peeking do you hear me back to king landing to joffrey and the queen follow my voice i'm right here you have something for me valar morghulis lady sansa you look very handsome my lord oh

a different kind of prison i just wanted to say i'm just trying to say very badly i just just want to say i know how you feel that the red fork i'm taking you to the twins i doubt that very much my lord you're right i have no idea how you feel and you have no idea how i feel but i promise you one thing my lady i won't ever hurt you do you drink wine when i have to well today you have to you look radiant your grace radiant why radiant it the word that came to mind but why we're going to be sisters soon we should be friends you're a musical girl aren't you i imagine you have a lovely voice a better dancer than a singer i'm afraid but you know the song the rains of castamere of course they play it so often here at court so you know the story of house reyne of castamere not as well as you i'm sure house reyne was a powerful family very wealthy the second wealthiest in westeros your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you aren't the tyrells the second wealthiest family in westeros now ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung if only you could take that final step you'd see further than all the rest you'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you so lord reyne built a castle as grand as casterly rock he gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore and finally one day he rebelled against my father do you know where house reyne is now gone why would they be at the twins gone a gentle word why not say "slaughtered" every man woman and child put to the sword i remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of casterly rock my father let them rot up there all summer it was a long summer "and now the rains weep o'er their halls and not a soul to hear " if you ever call me "sister" again i'll have

a corpse it only took your grace a year to learn dothraki reasonably well yes well it was either learn dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope what do you mean "reasonably well" dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master so guttural and harsh drogo said i spoke dothraki like one born to it it gave him great pride athjahakar athjahaka i'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side athjahakar athjahakar well i suppose i'm a bit out of practice your high valyrian is very good your grace the gods could not devise a more perfect tongue it is the only proper language for poetry no screaming or she dies what do you want you let her go hit me hard i imagine you're right don't scream lovely girl you were sent here to kill me so why haven't you i don't want to what do your captains have to say about that you should ask them why we had philosophical differences over what your beauty i'd like to talk to the titan bastard about winning it meant more to me than it did to them you're a strange man i'm the simplest man you'll ever meet i only do what i want to do and this is supposed to impress me yes why would i trust a man who murders his comrades they ordered me to murder you i

suppose it a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink a what well i mean there no real difference a wink is on purpose you thought of a name yet a man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl it would be easier to refer to him if he had a name sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me what no this is just the way i talk i'll build that fire don't you think he should have a name i don't know many boys' names let see there duncan kevan jon guymon feldan tristifer your grace allow me to present craster uh yes maybe that not mormont that a lovely idea but mormont a last name why is it a last name well it a family name for instance i'm samwell tarly samwell is my birth name and tarly is my family name you see so my father is also a tarly the captains of the second sons his name is samwell tarly too no randyll tarly randyll is a handsome name please don't name him randyll is your father cruel like mine different manner of cruel not randyll

better with a sword than he is with a lie you have 8 000 unsullied you're very young to be a captain he not a captain he a lieutet even if your numbers are right the odds don't favour your side the second sons have faced worse odds and won the second sons have faced worse odds and run or you could fight for me we've taken the slavers' gold we fight for yunkai someone worse than me would find you i would pay you as much and more our contract is our bond if we break our bond no one will hire the second sons again ride with me and you'll never need another contract you'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when i take back the seven kingdoms you have no ships you have no siege weapons you have no cavalry a fortnight ago i had no army a year ago i had no dragons you have two days to decide 0 game of thrones s03e09 the rains of castamere srt are you sure about this now winterfell is burnt to the ground this is where we enter the city very few guards they know me they let me inside we're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate i kill the guards i take your two best man and lead them through the back streets which i know well and open the front gates then comes the army once the walls are breached the city will fall in hours or perhaps you'll lead grey worm and me to the slaughter the north is overrun with ironborn and bran and rickon are gone cutting the head off our army the masters of yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners you have a very suspicious mind in my experience only dishonest people think this way you command the unsullied what do you think you are a leader now do you trust him so casterly rock i trust him you leave tonight very good we'll prepare ser jorah you can use an extra sword you're the queensguard ser barristan your place is by the queen if we are truly her loyal servants we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride we're west of castle black i'm asking your advice but the nightfort closest to us it was the first castle on the wall the watch abandoned it during the reign of king jaehaerys i too big impossible to maintain other than castle black itself the nightfort the perfect castle for us it got a secret sally port the black gate as old as the wall itself no one used it in centuries most likely it leads through the wall right down into the nightfort if one knows how to find it which it just so happens i do we have enough man how do you know all that i read about it in a very old book you know all that from staring at marks on paper yes you're like a wizard our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the wall and lived here we are alive remember what happens to children who run if walder frey cooperates i'm your father and i'll do the talking the roads have gone right to hell cracked three spokes this morning need a hand need about eight hands oh got to get this salt pork to the twins in time for the wedding many thanks don't don't kill him dead rats don't squeak if walder frey cooperates you're so dangerous aren't you saying scary things to little girls killing little boys and old people a real hard man you are more than anyone you know you're wrong i know a killer a real killer that so you'd be like a kitten to him he'd kill you with his little finger that him no good if reinforcemants arrive from king landing before we take the castle don't kill him please please don't you're very kind someday it'll get you killed where are we the gift i think brandon the builder gave all this land south of the wall to the night watch for their sustece and support maester luwin taught me that we'll be caught between tywin army and the sea doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the momant it good land and there no war up here why leave wildlings sorry but they come over the wall and raid steal carry off woman old said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it that what old said there a storm coming we'll lose the war and die the way father died i don't see any it as good a place to shelter as any we can drink some blood while we wait i don't need much only one old man and eight good horses what one old man doing with eight horses he breeds them for the watch how he keep folks from stealing them the watch protects him not today they don't no or worse he selling horses he got some gold in there and proper steel let carve him up we just take the horses and go the old man no threat i keep telling you he an old man a spear through the heart a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear the watch might send a few man looking for a horse thief they'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers show them how it feels to lose what they love i hope so killing crows in their castle is tough killing them out here in the open that what we do spread out surround the hut and move in ygritte clear the barn no one going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all best part of the animal don't worry they're still there i know they're still there you check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move my honoured guests i'm not afraid of course you are you're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it the closer you get the worse the fear gets no point in trying to hide behind that face i know fear when i see it seen it a lot i knew fear when i saw it in you you're afraid of fire when beric sword went up in flames be welcome within my walls and at my table you looked like a scared little girl and i know why too i heard what your brother did to you pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop that give you some ideas might do go ahead then you might get away might even make it there on your own they're just over the river the closest you've been to family i extend to you my hospitality since ilyn payne snipped your daddy neck someday i'll put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull how are we going to get past the wall my uncle said it 700 feet high how did you get past it got in a boat and rowed past

songbird whistle you come i'm a great whistler the greatest in the land daario naharis that one was quick my daughter walda my daughter derwa there may be others i doubt it the yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them that what you call a few guards come on what do you got huh lord edmure i hope i'm not a disappointmant to you you're a delight to me my lady you may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection in the sight of the seven i hereby seal these two souls binding them as one for eternity my daughter waldra look upon each other and say the words father

threw down their spears and surrendered and daario naharis my granddaughter the city is yours my queen they're good aren't they they ought to be because they cost enough look at the crowd there he complained about this marriage the entire ride from riverrun and now look at him the gods love to reward a fool uncle what he my nephew i love him and he a damned fool wertha don't you drink lord bolton never do my lady dulls the senses that the point didn't you marry one of these frey girls aye lord walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl weight in silver as a dowry so i have a fat young bride i hope she makes you very happy well she made me very rich pardon my lord my lady i need to find a tree to piss on waldra my mother alone with roose bolton i should rescue her your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman i've ever met be kind she finally starting to like you and i like her but if she had her way i would be back in volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of roslin frey hand perhaps i've made a terrible mistake striking your king is an act of treason no don't waldina don't insult them your grace the septon has prayed his prayers some words were said and lord edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak but they are not yet man and wife a sword needs a sheath and a wedding needs a bedding what does my sire say to bed to bed to bed i'm merry if you think the time is right lord walder by all means let us bed them to bed to bed to bed go on hoho careful now ladies once you set that monster free there no caging him again to bed to bed to bed poor girl fine every bride suffers the same i'm sure you endured yours with grace oh ned forbade it he said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man jaw on our wedding night that is a very strange custom i suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner perspective it seems normal to you it a tradition without the bedding ceremony there no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage and here my youngest daughter shirei no but there are other ways of providing proof boy or girl i don't know but if it a boy i know what we should name him oh do you it seems to me the father should have some say in his son naming eddard don't you want to teach little ned stark how to ride horses i do go on line 'em up though she hasn't bled yet whoa whoa whoa whoa where are you going got salt pork for the feast the feast is over doesn't sound like it over if i tell you it over it over turn this cart around and get the hell out of here got pig feet too are you soft in the head turn this cart around your grace clearly you don't have the patience for all that i feel i've been remiss in my duties i've given you meat and wine and music but i haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve my king has married and i owe my new queen a wedding gift robb ohh ahh ahh you ready to head home to winterfell eh feast over yet is it the lords of westeros will realise he not invincible my ladies aye it over aim it too late the king in the north arises lord walder lord walder enough let it end please he is my son my first son let him go and i swear that we will forget this all man should keep their word kings most of all i swear it by the old gods and new we will take no vengeance you already swore me one oath right here in my castle you swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter take me for a hostage but let robb go robb get up get up and walk out please please and why would i let him do that on my honour as a tully i was pledged to marry one of you and i broke that vow on my honour as a stark let him go or i will cut your wife throat i'll find another mother the lannisters send their regards the fault is not with you any man would be lucky to have any one of you i did what i did not to slight you but because i loved another i know these words cannot set right the wrong i have done to you and your house i beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all i can to make amands so the freys of the crossing take his home take his gold take his power and the starks of winterfell may once again be friends very good there she is come closer let me have a look at you still can't see you old eyes love that what the starks of winterfell call it eh very honourable i call it a pretty face mmm why are you telling me very pretty prettier than this lot that for sure very shapely as well oh you try to hide her under that dress if you wanted to hide her you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place i can always see what going on beneath a dress been at this a long time i bet when you take that dress off everything stays right where it is you begged me not to send theon doesn't drop an inch your king says he betrayed me for love i say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit and i can respect that when i was your age i'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought well i've enough room in the hall for you lot we'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your man thank you my lord well let get ready to negotiate with his father and i ignored your advice the wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us where there there it a back gate my man use it when they visit yunkai bed slaves your man but not you i have no interest in slaves a man cannot make love to property 0 game of thrones s03e10 mhysa srt go move out here comes the king in the north you're a fool if you believe he the most powerful man in westeros a treasonous statemant joffrey is king you really think a crown gives you power no i think armies give you power mmmhmm robb stark had one never lost a battle and you defeated him all the same mmmhmm oh i know ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall walder frey gets all the credit or the blame i suppose depending on your allegiance walder frey is many things but a brave man no he never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances which he got from me do you disapprove i'm all for cheating this is war but to slaughter them at a wedding ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10 000 man in battle than a dozen at dinner so that why you did it to save lives to end the war to protect the family do you want to write a song for the dead starks go ahead write one i'm in this world a little while longer to defend the lannisters to defend my blood the northerners will never forget good what are you doing let them remember what happens when they march on the south all the stark man are dead winterfell is a ruin roose bolton will be named warden of the north until your son by sansa comes of age i believe you still have some work to do on that score do you think she'll open her legs for me after i tell her how we murdered her mother and brother one way or another you will get that girl pregt i will not rape her i have a list shall i explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works use small words i'm not as bright as you the house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first a good man does everything in his power to better his family position regardless of his own selfish desires does that amuse you no it a very good lesson a list of people you mean to kill only it easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions easy for me is it when have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family the day that you were born i wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away instead i let you live and i brought you up as my son for laughing at me do i look like joffrey to you because you're a lannister sansa it empty let find a place to sleep hodor hodor don't hodor maybe we shouldn't stay here you'd rather be out there there are a lot of stories about this place no death seems a bit extreme horrible stories i always quite liked the horrible stories so did i once you ever heard about the rat cook no who he just a cook in the night watch he was angry at the king for something i don't remember when the king was visiting the nightfort the cook killed the king son cooked him into a big pie with onions carrots mushrooms and bacon fear of death on the other hand that night he served the pie to the king he liked the taste of his son so much he asked for a second slice the gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young he been roaming the nightfort ever since devouring his own babies but no matter what he does he always hungry if the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat it wasn't for murder the gods cursed the rat cook or for serving the king son in a pie he killed a guest beneath his roof you should learn to ignore them that something the gods can't forgive "the late walder frey " old tully called me because i didn't get my man to the trident in time for battle he thought he was witty look at us now tully you're dead your daughter dead your grandson dead your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and i'm lord of riverrun the blackfish escaped an old man on the run with no allies here comes the king in the north my lady people have been laughing at me i have tywin lannister backing me who does he have as you say they all laughed at me all those high lords they all thought they were better than me ned stark hoster tully people snigger when i marry a young girl but who said a word when jon arryn married the little tully bitch you'll be needing a new young girl yeah far longer than they've been laughing at you got that to look forward to hmm and you the warden of the north no more starks to bow and scrape to must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country he ignored my advice at every turn if he'd been a trifle less arrogant calling himself the "young wolf " how that for pomposity well here to the young wolf forever young i'm the halfman the demon monkey the imp will you move to winterfell now that the war over at some point perhaps but winterfell in ruins yeah what happened up there i heard the greyjoy boy seized the place i heard he killed all the ravens and after that nothing i sent my bastard ramsay to root him out robb stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us theon oh and ramsay delivered the terms you're a lannister the ironborn turned on theon as we knew they would they handed him over trussed and hooded but ramsay well ramsay has his own way of doing things well the girls weren't lying you had a goodsized cock what no pork sausage you think i'm some sort of savage people talk about phantom limbs i am the disgraced daughter of the traitor ned stark an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be so i've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock next time you think about naked girls will you feel an itch sorry i shouldn't make jokes my mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples but my father taught me to aim for their head kill me the disgraced daughter and the demon monkey sorry what kill me a little louder kill me you're no good to me dead we need you you don't look like a theon greyjoy any more that a name for a lord but you're not a lord are you you're just meat stinking meat we're perfect for each other you reek reek that a good name for you what your name theon greyjoy what your name theon greyjoy please what is your name reek so how should we punish them my name is reek hodor don't kill me who are you sam sam who are you gilly don't hurt us where are you going to castle black i'm a brother of the night watch my brother he in the night who your brother doesn't matter who whom you're jon brother the one who fell from the window no i'm not i've been around ghost enough to know a direwolf when i see one and

state of affairs i was born in flea bottom just like you sure you were you're my friend you're here to help i lived below the street of flour how far below how close to the red keep were you the shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of aegon hill along tanner row and right in front of my front door then you sew up the hole and make his bed again on gin alley gin alley the street of steel with your armour and your knights you lived in the fancy part of town and here we are now two boys from flea bottom in the castle of a king yeah we've come a long way we're all the same really she went to great pains to point that out to me if you mistrust fancy people so much why were you in such a hurry to trust her here comes the king in the north his room will stink but he won't know where it coming from you're me never been with a woman never talked to a woman really and then she comes at you big words no clothes what would you have done she does know her way around a man head i'll give her that so how'd you become a lord oh that a long story better not then i'm a bit busy lady sansa many years ago i helped king stannis out of a difficult situation he rewarded me with a lordship and this you see highborns i didn't want to be a lord i nearly didn't accept why did you i did it for my son i didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door my sister used to do that when she was angry with me i wanted him to have a better life does he he dead how'd he die following me when did you come to this strange country when i was 13 you were only a child i stopped being a child when i was nine my mother made sure of that and she was always angry with me you've been a good influence on our mutual friend you know he used to drink from sundown to sunup visit three brothels a night gamble away his father money now it just the drinking and now i'm his wife servant i brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot she is a sweet young thing none of this is her fault i love that girl i would kill for her do you think that makes it easier for me no i expect not why "sheep shift" she young and she beautiful and highborn we break bread with them but that doesn't make us family we've learned their language but we'll never be their countryman if you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of tywin lannister i have a name you have one name as do i here only the family name matters what do you want from me lord varys that the vulgar word for "dung " diamonds i'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth but you know how to protect yourself get on one of those ships sail to pentos or lys or myr you can buy a house with these diamonds a very large house hire servants start a new life a good life far from here the mysterious foreign beauty you'll have suitors lining up why do you want me to leave tyrion lannister is one of the few people alive my lady who could make this country a better place he has the mind the will and the right last name and you you are a complication i know you love him and i know it true love not bought by gold and silver i'm not asking you to leave him for money i'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him this will never be your home my lady well you asked me find a true home somewhere far from here while there still time lord varys if he wants me to leave he can tell me himself keep up i don't think i can my lord it not easy being drunk all the time everyone would do it if it were easy leave so enjoying married life that him an unhappy wife is a wine merchant best friend she doesn't deserve this deserve be careful with that start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend your days weeping for every person in the world there nothing worse than a lateblooming philosopher will you be facing your marriage to ser loras with the same philosophical spirit my lord my lady i won't be marrying ser loras i seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage you're not me you want to make things better for sansa give her a child so you can tell father it was you who finally talked me into it so she can have some happiness in her life you have children how happy would you say you are not very but if it weren't for my children the king in the north the king in the north your father has called a meeting of the small council i'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the red keep they're the reason i'm alive

always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies killed a few puppies today "we should have known even then we should have known " it nonsense whenever he was with me he was happy and no one can take that away from me not even joffrey how it feels to have someone someone of your own how long does it go on until we've dealt with all our enemies every time we deal with an enemy we create two more then i suppose it will go on for quite a long time show him i'm telling you that what she did sounded like a cow in heat aye not for long that right black walder shut her up right quick none of
