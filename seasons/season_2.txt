torrhen square in a summer man worked back then today my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children are you drunk no at night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps gods forbid it rains why i might as well sleep beneath a waterfall maintece of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast generally yes but i've sent all the young man off to fight robb stark war king robb and it not his war he didn't choose it maybe not my lord but he called in his banners and took the man joffrey killed my father no no your grace your liege lord do you remember your vows ser of course i remember we can spare four masons for a week my lord will that be sufficient to repair your walls i believe it will we didn't want him here all day did we i didn't like the way he was talking

and full of terrors for the night is dark and full of terrors after the long summer darkness will fall heavy on the world the stars will bleed we need to stop her take him away the cold breath of winter will freeze the seas not now and the dead shall rise in the north all you man were named in the light of the seven is this how you treat the gods of your fathers are you so eager to spit on your ancestors you smell of fear fear and piss and old bones do you want to stop me stop me in the ancient books it written i'll have him killed tomorrow the fool that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire and that sword shall be lightbringer stannis baratheon warrior of light your sword awaits you lord cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors for the night is dark and full of terror this woman will lead him into a war he cannot win stannis is our king he is a fool you're so clever to see it we follow where he leads even if we don't like the path king since that boar killed his brother every lord wants a coronation i don't serve the others i serve stannis as do i but loyal service means telling hard truths he surrounded by fools and fanatics but he trusts you davos if you tell him the truth what the truth he'll make a much better fool than a knight "and i declare upon the honour of my house that my beloved brother robert " he wasn't my beloved brother i didn't love him he didn't love me a harmless courtesy your grace a lie take it out "that my brother robert left no trueborn heirs "the boy joffrey the boy tomman and the girl myrcella being born of incest "between cersei lannister and her brother jaime lannister "by right of birth " jaime lannister the kingslayer call him what he is he doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death "and her brother jaime lannister the kingslayer " "by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim " make it ser jaime lannister the kingslayer whatever else he is the man still a knight "ser jaime lannister the kingslayer "by right of birth and blood "i do this day lay claim to the iron throne of westeros "let all true man declare their loyalty " when eddard stark learned the truth he told only me i'll not make the same mistake did you hear my lady ser dontos send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm from the arbor to the wall the time has come to choose let no man claim ignorance as an excuse your grace the lannisters are the true enemy if for the time being you could make peace with your brother i'll not make peace with renly while he calls himself king well many have already declared for him mace tyrell randyll tarly stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support it was well struck your grace from this day you'll be my new fool the lord of light stands behind him and how many ships has the lord of light got in his fleet he has no need for ships i'm sure he doesn't but we do if we're going to war if not renly your grace join forces with robb stark who would steal the northern half of my kingdom i've always served thieves according to their deserts as you well know ser davos joffrey renly robb stark they're all thieves they'll bend the knee or i'll destroy them i owe you an apology my king thank you your grace my duty is to serve you have chosen the new god over the old gods may the lord of light watch over us all shall we drink together don't a cup of wine to honour the one true god the night is dark and full of terrors old man but the fire burns them all away king in the north i keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping and you my lady thank you but you drag me along from camp to camp have you grown fond of me stark is that it i've never seen you with a girl if i left you with one of my bannerman your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message "release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams "refuse and your house will be destroyed root and stem " you don't trust the loyalty of the man following you into battle beloved nephew oh i trust them with my life just not with yours smart boy what wrong don't like being called "boy" insulted you insult yourself kingslayer you've been defeated by a boy you're held captive by a boy perhaps you'll be killed by a boy we looked for you on the battlefield stannis baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of westeros king joffrey baratheon is neither a true king nor a true baratheon he your bastard son if that true stannis is the rightful king how convenient for him my father learned the truth that why you had him executed i was your prisoner when ned stark lost his head your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him you were nowhere to be found and you you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen you have proof or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives i'm sending one of your cousins down to king landing with my peace terms you think my father going to negotiate with you you don't know him very well no but he starting to know me three victories don't make you a conqueror it better than three defeats i've been here ruling the kingdoms this city stinks like dead bodies a bit corpsey yes and shit i thought you wanted to come here i love it you love the smell of dead bodies and shit and cum and garlic and rum you can smell cum from the balcony i love the stink i love the noise what a fine job you've done cities make me want to fuck and so did the country this is where i belong yes well you need to be careful no one can know you're here no one will know you can't trust anyone in king landing they're all liars good liars bad liars one or two great liars what about you look at you me i'm not from here i'm a slave to the truth truth you are the biggest little liar i have ever met why do you think i am so little i'm being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth ned stark actually slept on this as if the poor man didn't suffer enough one of the many changes we'll have to make around here lord baelish your grace more beautiful than ever i wonder if i might ask you for a favour of course your grace ned stark youngest daughter arya we can't seem to locate her if she escaped the capital winterfell seems the logical destination and yet my friends in the north report no sign of her curious if we choose to negotiate with the starks the girl has some value whoever finds her well you know what they say about lannisters and debts i already said it was well struck and you well you could ask varys where she is he'll have an answer for you whether you believe it myself i have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs who knows what they want a mockingbird you created your own sigil didn't you yes appropriate for a selfmade man with so many songs to sing i'm glad you like it some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family you're going to be bigger than the hound others have to find their own way i heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family he loved the eldest daughter sadly she had eyes for another when boys and girls live in the same home awkward situations can arise sometimes i've heard even brothers and sisters develop certain affections and when those affections become common knowledge well that is an awkward situation indeed but much better looking especially in a prominent family but prominent families often forget a simple truth i've found and which truth is that knowledge is power seize him cut his throat stop wait i've changed my mind let him go step back three paces this one doesn't like me turn around close your eyes power is power do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me i would very much appreciate it you're ser alton lannister i am your grace i offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms first your family must release my sisters can't imagine why second my father bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath winterfell and the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned their families can honour them with proper funerals an honourable request your grace third joffrey and the queen regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the north from this time till the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom the king in the north king in the north king in the north neither joffrey nor any of his man shall set foot in our lands again we heard you were dead i'm glad you're not dead if he disregards this command he shall suffer the same fate as my father only i don't need a servant to do my beheading for me these are your grace these are these are my terms if the queen regent and her son meet them i'll give them peace if not i will litter the south with lannister dead king joffrey is a baratheon your grace oh is he me too dear death is so boring you'll ride at daybreak ser alton that will be all for tonight a word your grace you don't have to call me "your grace" when no one around it not so bad once you get used to it i'm glad someone gotten used to it the lannisters are going to reject your terms you know of course they are we can fight them in the fields as long as you like but we won't beat them until you take king landing especially now with so much excitemant in the world and we can't take king landing without ships my father has ships and man who know how to sail them man who fought my father man who fought king robert to free themselves from the yoke of the south just like you're doing now i'm his only living son he'll listen to me i know he will i'm not a stark i know that but your father raised me to be an honourable man we can avenge him together my lady i'm sorry for your loss you don't want balon greyjoy for an ally i need his ships they say he has 200 they say a million rats live in the sewers of king landing shall we rally them to fight for us i understand you don't trust lord greyjoy i don't trust lord greyjoy because he is not trustworthy your father had to go to war to end his rebellion yes and now i'm the one rebelling against the throne before me it was father you married one rebel and mothered another her loss i mothered more than just rebels a fact you seem to have forgotten if i trade the kingslayer for two girls my bannerman will string me up by my feet you want to leave sansa in the queen hands and arya i haven't heard a word about arya what are we fighting for if not for them it more complicated than that you know it is it time for me to go home i haven't seen bran or rickon in months you can't go to winterfell yes your grace her father was a confessed traitor i beg your pardon i'll send rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you'll ride south to the stormlands why in the name of all the gods because i need you to negotiate with renly baratheon he rallied an army of 100 000 you know him you know his family i haven't seen renly baratheon since he was a boy you have a hundred other lords which of these lords do i trust more than you but still her father if renly sides with us we'll outnumber them two to one when they feel the jaws beginning to shut they'll sue for peace we'll get the girls back then we'll all go home for good i will ride at first light we will all be together again soon i promise you've done so well your father would be proud give lord renly my regards king renly surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathise there a king in every corner now what is all this returning this room to its proper appearance say what you will about the targaryens they were conquerors that is a seat for a conqueror it needs a room to match it not vines and flowers we can't find arya stark with luck she dead in a ditch somewhere perhaps but if not we need her they'll never give jaime back to us for sansa alone my father was a traitor i think they might they're weak they put too much value on their woman we need to set our armies to the task of finding her send out as many man as we can i'm sure if you asked grandfather the king does not ask he commands and my grandfather stupidity in the field of battle is the reason robb stark has uncle jaime in the first place his life is in danger we're at war my mother and brother are traitors too all our lives are in danger i heard a disgusting lie about uncle jaime and you our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne it not a claim the throne is mine of course it is no one believes this foul gossip someone believes it father had other children besides me and tomman and myrcella i am loyal to my beloved joffrey what are you asking i'm asking if he fucked other woman when he grew tired of you how many bastards does he have running what you just did is punishable by death you will never do it again never that will be all mother no no no no do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound ease into it of course you are slowly with passion oh yeah go wash yourselves put some clothes on both of you

maesters all over the seven kingdoms and declared this great summer done at last the longest summer in living memory the peasants say a long summer means an even longer winter a common superstition

companions i will your grace safe travels cousin you have a deft hand with diplomacy if that everything a raven flew in this morning from castle black trouble with the wildlings that why they're

courtesy five i've lost count the lord commander asks that we send more man to man the wall perhaps he forgotten we're fighting a war we have no man to spare "the cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them " the northerners are a superstitious people according to the commander one of these dead man attacked him in his chambers mormont doesn't lie how do you kill a dead man apparently you burn him a man must ask forgiveness one trip to the wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks i don't know what i believe but here a fact for you: the night watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the wall i have every confidence that the brave man of the night watch will protect us all and i said "if the gods wanted us to have dignity "they wouldn't make us fart when we died " we fart when we die my blessed mother you're called arry i was holding her hand when she left this world she farted so hard the whole bed shook seems a bit greedy for one man to

acquired from a lysene pleasure house beautiful like yourself and intelligent like yourself hmm then you're stupid but she wasn't happy she cried often i asked her why but we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and i have yes it was quite sad girls from the lysene pleasure houses are expensive extremely expensive and this one wasn't making me any money i hate bad investmants really i do put a watch on the ridge and the tree lines they scare me they haunt me i had no idea how to make her happy no idea how to mitigate my losses a very wealthy patron he offered me a tremandous amount of money to let him transform this lovely sad girl to use her in ways that would never occur to most man but you know what occurs to most man i would not say he succeeded in making her happy what are gold cloaks doing so far from king landing but my losses were definitely mitigated take tonight off to mourn mhaegen child i'll see you tomorrow and you'll be happy that makes me happy more wine damn

good red dornish you know your wines my lord that i do a fine dinner my lord call me tyrion please i'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners now that you're a lord maybe i'll hire this cook of yours wars have been started for less i heard there was some trouble in littlefinger brothel the other night they're looking for me mmm nasty business had to be done yes of course the city watch must keep the peace only i hadn't realised peace depended on killing babies orders are orders quite right especially the queen orders i never said they were the queen orders no but who else would want to murder king robert bastards she always been a jealous woman you in command here you know your sister better than i do you've heard the awful rumours about my brother and sister i don't listen to filth that good of you but you have heard them i suppose people who do believe that filth consider robert bastards to be better claimants to the throne than cersei children joffrey is my king the rest doesn't interest me i appreciate your loyalty tell me when your man slaughtered ned stark man in the throne room did you give the order you're a long way from home i did and i would again the man was a traitor he tried to buy my loyalty the fool he had no idea you were already bought are you drunk i'll not have my honour questioned by an imp i'm not questioning your honour lord janos i'm denying its existence i asked you a question if you think i'll stand here and take this from you dwarf dwarf you should have stopped at imp and yes you will stand here and take it from me unless you'd like to take it from my friend here i intend to serve as hand of the king until my father returns from the war and seeing as you betrayed the last hand of the king well i just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about what are you my friends at court will not allow this aye you did the queen herself has granted the queen regent and you're a fool to believe she is your friend we shall hear what joffrey has to say about this no we shan't there a ship leaving for eastwatchbythesea tonight from there i'm afraid it rather a long walk to castle black i hope you enjoy the wall i found it surprisingly beautiful in a brutal horribly uncomfortable sort of way the lads will escort you you asked without manners the streets aren't safe at night my lord these man are under my command i command you to arrest this cutthroat his name is bronn and he is the new commander of the city watch boys i have friends at court powerful friends the king himself made me a lord to the new commander and i chose not to answer if i told you to murder an infant girl say still at her mother breast would you do it without question without question no i'd ask "how much" if they come back i say we yield gendry the one

go back to your city and tell your masters all these kings fighting for the throne and this stannis has the smallest army why would i bet on the man with the worst chance because you're a smart gambler stannis has proved himself in war twice his baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield neither has the false king joffrey and yet they both have larger armies stannis has just begun the fight his bannerman will rally to his cause you didn't find what you were looking for there no man in the seven kingdoms more honourable than stannis baratheon or more worthy of loyalty what is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honour of kings mind your words pirate matthos you think i'm insulted i am a pirate i'm an excellent pirate i don't sail for promises of course you do every time you leave harbour you're leaving on a promise what do you want we're looking for a boy named gendry a promise that somewhere on the sea somebody got some gold and you can take it from him that a promise that always comes true as is mine you're not a young man salladhor and correct me if i'm wrong most pirates don't grow old only the clever ones you want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from pentoshi cheesemongers and myrenese silk merchants then go they're out there waiting for you that easy what i'm offering you is hard he carries a bull head helmet come with me and plunder the greatest city in westeros you'll be the richest man in lys and the most famous they'll be singing songs about you as long as man have voices to sing "salladhor saan" is a good name for songs it is one thing i want the queen the queen cersei i want her i'll sail with your fleet all 30 of my ships and if we don't drown at the bottom of blackwater bay i will fuck this blonde queen and i'll fuck her well this war isn't about you anyone turning him over will earn the king reward we're not attacking king landing so that you can rape the queen i'm not going to rape her i'm going to fuck her as if she would just let you you don't know how persuasive i am i've never tried to fuck you stannis is the rightful king and the lord of light the one true god i've been all over the world my boy and everywhere i go people tell me about the true gods they all think they found the right one we'll be back with more man the one true god is what between a woman legs and better yet a queen legs i never thought you'd have a true believer for a son he young yet i promise you the gold i promise you the glory i cannot promise you the queen you believe your king can win he is the one true king you westerosi are funny people a man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him and i'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy i'll sail with you davos seaworth you're the most honest smuggler i ever met make me rich get me to the gates of king landing and i will when will the king have us sail as soon as his god wills it he my god too and yours but you are too blind to see let me teach you how to read oh you and your mother it won't take long you already know the letters my lord the holy books are much more persuasive than i can be i wish i had a god truly i'm not mocking you but i've seen man pray to every god there is pray for wind pray for rain pray for home none of it works but you always came home i wasn't praying but i was every night that you were at sea i lit a candle and i prayed for you you want me to have a god you make me wait a long time fine king stannis is my god he raised me up and blessed me with his trust he gave you a future i could never have imagined you know how to read you'll be a knight someday you think a fire god commanded all that it was stannis only stannis stannis is my king but he only a man don't tell him that lord janos slynt was commander of the city watch you had no right to exile him but your friend keeps me company i have every right i am the king hand you're serving as the king hand till father gets here i am queen regent listen to me queen regent you're losing the people do you hear me the people you think i care you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead half the city will starve when winter comes the other half will plot to overthrow you and your goldplated thugs just gave them their rallying cry we were just speaking of your bravery "the queen slaughters babies " you don't even have the decency to deny it it wasn't you who gave the order was it joffrey didn't even tell you did he tell you i imagine that would be even worse he did what needed to be done you want to be hand of the king you want to rule this is what ruling is lying on a bed of weeds ripping them out by the root one by one in the victory against the stark auxiliary forces before they strangle you in your sleep i'm no king but i think there more to ruling than that i don't care what you think you've never taken it seriously you haven't jaime hasn't it all fallen on me as has jaime repeatedly according to stannis baratheon you're funny you've always been funny but none of your jokes will ever match the first one will they a man has a thirst it was quite a battle you remember back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death she was my mother too mother gone for the sake of you there no bigger joke in the world than that your grace your grace how did you fare with your pirate salladhor saan will join our fleet 30 ships i heard you suffered a terrible head wound his man know how to fight in my experience pirates prefer fighting unarmed man it does seem the wiser choice there won't be a choice this time do you trust him salladhor saan is an old friend i've known him 30 years i've never trusted him now once he gets the smell of gold he never stops well if he does his job he'll have his share leave us the northerners are such fearsome warriors at once your grace the lord of light shines through you young warrior come what did you say to him i told him death by fire is the purest death why because it is true you're troubled my king yeah these armies are toys for the lord of light tell your lord to burn them then and i tell him the story of how we meet i tell him nothing i pray for his commands and i obey my little brother has 100 000 man according to the scouts man whose allegiance rightly belongs to me you must have faith faith in a real war the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten then we must be the 10th i cannot defeat my brother in the field to find so lovely a creature working in your father kitchens and i can't take king landing without the man he stolen i have seen the path to victory in the flames but first you must give yourself to the lord of light i've said the words damn you i burned the idols you must give all of yourself i have a wife i took a vow she sickly weak shut away in a tower it almost beggars belief she disgusts you and she given you nothing no sons only stillborns only death i will give you a son my king a son strange things do happen you should taste her fish pie i don't think lord varys likes fish pie how can you tell i can always tell a man does not drink for a day and a night man like lord varys and i can't let our disadvantages get the best of us we'll make a fisherman of him yet i am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital friends are such an important part of life unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come but rest easy my lord i am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends your discretion is legendary where your friends are concerned how unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest a boy could make a friend i will leave you welcome to king landing my dear this city is made brighter by your presence we have a council meeting my lord i don't like threats who threatened you i'm not ned stark i understand the way this game is played ned stark was a man of honour and i

boy you were a fat little boy too but i recognised you why didn't you tell me i wanted to see who you were first and i did the plans are made it time you heard them father father offerings the wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the northern army at his back while he tangling with the lion in the westerlands the north is ripe for the taking the ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days all along the northern coast we'll spread our dominion across the green lands securing the neck and everything above every stronghold will yield to us one by one winterfell may defy us for a year but what of it he murdering his own children he a monster the rest shall be ours forest field and hall yara my daughter you'll take 30 longships to attack deepwood motte i've always wanted a castle and what my role in all this you'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the stoney shore a ship you give her 30 and i get one the sea bitch we thought she'd be perfect for you this bastard been meddling where he shouldn't aye many a time that monster has been the difference i'm to fight fisherman be careful of their nets father i fought with robb stark i know his man he won't give up the north so easily they won't even know we're there until it too late what do you know of it woman i'm a proven warrior your brothers were warriors both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect i'm not protecting anyone i just wonder if it not wiser to wait between life and death for our rangers why risk going against the north if they would be our allies rise up against them and they could destroy us but if we pledge fealty to them they'll give us casterly rock what are our words our words we do not sow we do not sow we are ironborn we're not subjects we're not slaves we do not plough the fields or toil in the mine your uncle among them we take what is ours your time with the wolves has made you weak you act as if i volunteered to go you gave me away if you remember the day you bent the knee to robert baratheon after he crushed you did you take what was yours then you gave me away your boy your last boy we have other wars to fight out there you gave me away like i was some dog you didn't want any more and now you curse me because i've come home you'd have our father bow down to your other family i have no other family don't you make your choice

craster he 300 miles away i don't intend for you to stay here i might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens again only temporary every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore i am but you wouldn't be a cook you'd pose as a scullion scullion what is a scullion kitchen wench a kitchen wench yes but i cleaning pots is that how my lion wants to see me your lion wants to see you alive we've come to a dangerous place my sister wants to hurt me she'll look for any weakness she can find she can't know about you i'm the weakness it a complimant my lady how is being a weakness a complimant language can be a bit tricky here i saw it oh i'm too stupid to understand the stupid foreign girl i am not a kitchen wench when will joffrey and sansa be married soon darling when the war is over mother says i'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast but yours will be ivory since you're the bride the princess just spoke to you i saw pardon your grace

linens wash my clothing yeah whatever it was scrub the floor empty my chamber pot brush my hair no you said to brush not now your chamber pot is empty clean the table have you ever been a handmaiden before yes for whom lady zuriff lady zuriff lady zuriff there is no lady zuriff in this city i want you and your man i daresay you'll see it again she wasn't in this city i don't know how they did things in that city but in this city handmaidens wait on ladies not the other way around and i don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job do you want me to leave just brush my hair oh thank the gods now ready my horse i haven't had a proper shit in six days i've encountered this problem before my lord the stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect two drops with water daily right i'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side please thank you my lord i can trust you pycelle can i not why yes of course my lord we leave at dawn these are perilous times and the crown must forge new alliances and these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony matrimony huh yes i'm trusting the council with these plans but the queen mustn't know we can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm there too much at stake oh yes yes indeed yes i shall be silent as the grave don't lose it again i'm brokering an alliance with house martell of dorne princess myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it myrcella sent away to dorne but remember the queen mustn't know ooh "the queen mustn't know " i love conversations that begin this way i plan to marry princess myrcella off gilly to theon greyjoy theon greyjoy forgive me my lord but how he grew up a ward of winterfell he fights for robb stark precisely theon father loathes the starks and will convince the boy to come to our side greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have his father ships but remember you must tell no one tell no one what you're leaving i plan to wed princess myrcella to robin arryn of the vale lysa is not fond of me but perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones she imprisoned you she tried to execute you and you offer her son a princess for man in our position holding grudges can be an encumbrance don't you think and i suppose you want me to broker this agreemant who better yes i could sing this song to lysa if i cared to i i wanted to give you something what in it for me the gratitude of the people of westeros for helping to end this war the adoration of the king for bringing the vale back into the fold and harrenhal harrenhal is cursed never took you for a superstitious man by all means tear it down and rebuild you'll be able to afford it i plan to make you lord of the riverlands with a single stroke you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm you served my family well in the matter of the succession it belonged to my mother so did janos slynt and he was given harrenhal too until you snatched it away i need you to deliver lysa arryn i didn't need janos slynt it settled then good oh and remember the queen mustn't know that must hurt what i can't take it please what is it a member of the kingsguard as if i wasn't humiliated enough already brienne is a very capable warrior and she devoted to me you're jealous jealous of brienne the beauty don't make me laugh i'll make it up to you no your grace i want you to not tonight there another tyrell who requires your attention you didn't win my father support or his army on charm alone your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night and margaery a virgin officially shall i bring her to you i should warn you i've had quite a bit of wine as is your right you are a king gone my mother used it for sewing you look very beautiful thank you your grace it a lovely gown you think so i can't decide how i like it better this way or this way you certainly don't need it although some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed must be the wine she'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed here let me i'm sorry do you want my brother to come in and help what he could get you started i know he wouldn't mind or i can turn over and you can pretend i'm him i don't know what you're talking about there no need for us to play games save your lies for court you're going to need a lot of them your enemies aren't happy about us they want to tear us apart and i'd read to her and the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly we can try again later you decide how you want to do it with me with me and loras however else you like whatever you need to do you are a king you monster myrcella is my only daughter my father put a stop to it when he found out do you really think i'll let you sell her like a common whore myrcella a princess some would say she was born for this i will not let you ship her off to dorne as i was shipped off to robert baratheon dorne is the safest place for her are you mad the martells loathe us that why we need to seduce them we're going to need their support in the war your son started she'll be a hostage a guest you won't get away with this you think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe it the only thing i have of hers ned stark had a piece of paper too it done cersei no you cannot stop it no just how safe do you think myrcella is if this city falls do you want to see her raped butchered like the targaryen children make no mistake they'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours get out get out theon of the house greyjoy you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned god she gave it to me before i left for the wall i would kneel let theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel what is dead may never die what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger stand you i don't appreciate being made a fool of dwarf if myrcella marries the martell boy she can't very well marry robin arryn can she no afraid not sorry about that and harrenhal i suppose that off the table as well yes i fear so sorry about that too leave me out of your next deception that a shame you were to be the centrepiece of my next deception you shouldn't give it away my brother jaime rots in a northern stockade i would see him released that where you come in robb stark will never release the kingslayer no he won't but his mother might how would you like to see your beloved cat again find him oh aye and he has company filthy old stoat almost hate to interrupt no you don't no i don't i'm not giving it away what is the meaning of this no please please you disappoint me grand maester i am your loyal servant so loyal that you told the queen about my plans to send myrcella to dorne no never it a falsehood i swear it it wasn't me ah varys it was varys the spider i'm giving it to you see i told varys that i was giving the princess to the greyjoys i told littlefinger that i planned to wed her to robin arryn i told no one that i was offering her to the dornish no one but you the eunuch has spies everywhere cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats no no no there are no goats halfman well make do how long have you been spying for my sister all i did i did for house lannister and you will make this right keep it safe for me always your lord father ask him i've always been his servant since the days of the mad king i don't like his beard what what no no how many hands have you betrayed pycelle eddard stark jon arryn lord arryn he knew he knew the truth about the queen and he planned to act to tell king robert so you poisoned him till i come back no never but you let him die made sure he succumbed lannister i always served lannister get him out of my sight throw him in one of the black cells no no no no no please don't you can't do this to me for your trouble you'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in lady sansa service good one of my better ideas hodor and it seems the grand maester has found his way into a black cell well played my lord hand but should i be worried janos slynt pycelle the small council grows smaller every day the council has a reputation for serving past hands poorly i don't mean to follow ned stark to the grave power is a curious thing my lord are you fond of riddles why am i about to hear one hodor three great man sit in a room a king a priest and a rich man between them stands a common sellsword each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two who lives who dies depends on the sellsword does it he has neither crown nor gold nor favour with the gods he has a sword the power of life and death but if it swordsman who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power when ned stark lost his head who was truly responsible rouse bran will you it time for his lessons joffrey the executioner or something else i've decided i don't like

cold before you secured your newest patron i'm a practical man just not a loyal one and who would you have me be loyal to there something out there your brother corpse i don't like you lord baelish i don't like your face i don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth i don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary so tell me why are you here you can trust brienne her loyalty comes without charge you still have many friends at court your grace many who believe ned stark erred by not supporting your claim now i understand oh you know i have the numbers you know i'm marching on king landing when i take the throne you hope to retain your position and your head i would give priority to my head i understand that you don't like me and while that saddens me greatly i did not come here today seeking your affection when you march on king landing you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates your grace oh you're a right little prick lord baelish all of these tents look the same to me would you be so kind it would be my pleasure it took me weeks to learn my way around the camp twice i walked in on officers in stages of undress and the momant i learn which tent is mine we're on the move again "your tent" not "our tent" the king snores perhaps or simply prefers solitude pressures of command no doubt he the strongest bulls are bigger than lions you should see your face four kings vying for the throne i am not tutored in warfare but basic arithmetic favours the side with the greater numbers if war were arithmetic the mathematicians would rule the world i did notice your brother entering his grace tent just now the place of a kingsguard is by the king side and on the night of your wedding who was by the king side then you seem quite interested in our marriage your marriage is quite interesting not only to me but to the realm i swear you pissed yourself the marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest if nothing else you've never married have you i've been unlucky in my affections sadly that is sad though perhaps it for the best the whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you so allow me to explain my husband is my king and my king is my husband here is your tent lord baelish good night this isn't your horse "oh who goes there ahh" it was given to me by the thirteen the elders of qarth qarth three days to the east on the sea will they

in the north sansa more beautiful than ever and arya just as wild as ever you have arya too both girls are healthy and safe for now but you know the queen and you know joffrey i fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital what do you want the lannisters will trade your daughters for the kingslayer of course they will five lannisters dead for every one of ours jaime lannister for two girls robb will never agree to those terms i'm not bringing these terms to him i'm bringing them to you you think i keep secrets from my son robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle but he not a mother consider it cat you may not get another chance i've brought you a gift i don't want your gifts they're dead take everything they've got a token of tyrion lannister goodwill he wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith good faith what this your husband was an honourable man he should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath winterfell you may not believe get out get up you dogs that him the one who picks doesn't mean i'd pick a bull in a fight we've nowhere to keep all these prisoners the mountain what are you doing he told me he stares at him every day that why he doesn't get picked you move boy move is there gold and silver in the village i don't know gems i didn't see any barely enough food to feed our own where is the brotherhood i don't know where is the brotherhood i don't know please where is the brotherhood i don't know which of the villagers aided them i don't know who i who i never saw who i never saw please please stop please it starting to who i didn't see anyone help him we're not executing prisoners lord bolton take it off take it off who helped him ganes the butcher and his son that better you've been very helpful no stop please what are you doing please stop please stop no no i told you everything no no joffrey cersei of course your grace ilyn payne the hound please polliver some food just a crust of bread polliver the mountain lady stark i had not thought to find you in the stormlands i had not thought to be here lord stannis can that truly be you who else might it be when i saw your standard i couldn't be sure whose banner is that my own the officers will be useful i suppose if we used the same one the battle would be terribly confusing why is your stag on fire the king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the lord of light ah you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about mmm brother now i understand why you found religion in your old age watch yourself renly no no i'm relieved i never really believed you were a fanatic charmless rigid a bore yes some of them may be privy to tywin lannister plans but not a godly man you should kneel before your brother he the lord chosen born amidst salt and smoke born amidst salt and smoke is he a ham that twice i've warned you listen to yourselves if you were sons of mine i would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers it is strange to find you beside my brother lady stark i doubt it your husband was a supporter of my claim lord eddard integrity cost him his head and you sit beside this pretender and chastise me we share a common enemy the iron throne is mine by right all those that deny that are my foes the whole realm denies it from dorne to the wall old man deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother wombs no one wants you for their king well we'll learn soon enough you never wanted any friends brother but a man without friends is a man without power for the sake of the mother who bore us i will give you this one night to reconsider strike your banners come to me before dawn and i will grant you your old seat in the council i'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me otherwise i shall destroy you look across those fields brother can you see all those banners in my family we say "a naked man has few secrets you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king no the man holding those bolts of cloth will make me king we shall see renly come the dawn we shall see look to your sins lord renly the night is dark and full of terrors would you believe i loved him once i thought we were welcome if you heard a dothraki horde was approaching your city "a flayed man none " you might do the same khaleesi horde my name is daenerys daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen you know me my lord only by reputation khaleesi and i'm no lord merely a humble merchant they call you the mother of dragons and what should i call you oh my name is quite long if the bull had fangs and claws i would my father outlawed flaying in the north and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce i am simply a trader of spices but we are the thirteen charged with the goverce and protection of qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be the beauty of quarth is legendary qarth qarth might we see the dragons my friend we have travelled very far we're not in the north we're not torturing them we have no food no water once i see my people fed i would be honoured forgive me mother of dragons but no man alive has seen a living dragon some of my more sceptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist all we ask is the chance to see for ourselves i am not a liar oh i don't think you are the high road very pretty but as i've never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value where i come from guests are treated with respect not insulted at the gates then perhaps you should return to where you come from we wish you well what are you doing you promised to receive me we have received you here we are and here you are but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it if you do not let us in all of us will die which we shall deeply regret but qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting dothraki savages through its gates khaleesi please be careful thirteen when my dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me we will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground turn us away and we will burn you first the lannisters hold prisoners of their own ah you are a true targaryen only as you said a momant ago if we don't let you into the city you will all die and so retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be the discussion is over xaro xhoan daxos the thirteen have spoken i am one of the thirteen i won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters and i am still speaking the girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine she is the mother of dragons do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire i believe we can allow a few dothraki through our gates without dooming our city after all here i am a savage from the summer isles and qarth still stands our decision is final no don't don't please very well i invoke soumai i will vouch for her her people and her dragons in accordance with the law be it on your head welcome to qarth my lady you is there gold or silver in the village i'm not from the village where is the brotherhood i don't know what that is you two take lord lannister things to his quarters the rot set in what this we weren't expecting you till tomorrow lord tywin evidently not why are these prisoners not in their cells cells are overflowing my lord this lot won't be here long don't need no permanent place after we interrogate 'em we usually just are we so wellmanned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled labourers you do you have a trade no don't no don't smith my lord what are you looking at kneel kneel or i'll carve your lungs out boy he'll do no such thing this one a girl you idiot dressed as a boy why safer to travel my lord smart more than i can say for this lot get these prisoners to work shh please don't bring the girl i need a new cupbearer my lord your visits are too few cousin her grace the queen regent commands you to release grand maester pycelle here your warrant so it is will you take a cup with me i find that mulled wine helps me sleep i am here at her grace behest not to drink with you imp right the mountain or our man jaime it'll get better it doesn't even hurt if my sister was so concerned for pycelle i would have thought she'd come herself instead she sends you what am i to make of that i don't care what you make of it so long as you release your prisoner immediately and you've received these instructions directly from cersei as i said several times and you've waited this long to deliver the information when the queen regent gives me a command i carry it out without delay cersei must have great trust in you the rot will spread if we don't take the foot now allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf the queen regent has a great many responsibilities she often works from dusk till dawn she must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn ah lavender oil she always loved lavender oil even as a girl i am a knight an anointed knight yes tell me did cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed no you can't what nothing to say no more warnings for me ser you will withdraw these filthy accusations have you ever given any thought to what king joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother it not my fault did she take you against your will can you not defend yourself knight your own father lord tywin when i was named the king squire he told me to obey her in everything ser please ser did he tell you to fuck her too i only meant i did as i was bid hated every momant of it is that what you'll have me believe a high place in court a knighthood my sister legs spreading open for you at night oh yes it must have been terrible wait here his grace will want to hear this mercy mercy my lord i beg you save it for joffrey he loves a good grovel my lord it was your sister bidding the queen i can't lose you'll die if she doesn't i'll leave the city at once i swear no i think not my lord you heard me my father told you to obey my sister obey her stay close to her side keep her trust pleasure her whenever she requires no one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me i want to know what cersei is doing where she goes who she sees what they talk of everything and you will tell me i don't want to be a cripple please yes my lord i will i swear it as you command oh rise rise let us drink to our understanding oh you don't have a cup oh well smile cousin my sister is a beautiful woman and it all for the good of the realm go back and tell her that i beg her forgiveness that i want no more conflict between us and that henceforth i shall do nothing without her consent but her demands surely one of our man needs your attention more than this cub oh i'll give her pycelle you will yes i'll release him in the morning cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants but i will not have him on the council i could swear that i had not harmed a single hair on his head but that would not strictly speaking be true stay within one table length your grace do your knucklebones bring you luck well life been good since you hacked them off your grace and it four less fingernails to clean your man are not my man my lord fewer pardon four fewer fingernails to clean never understood why you had to wear them it reminds me of where i come from and where i am now it reminds me of your justice it was an honest punishmant and you were good with the cleaver you were a hero and a smuggler a good act does not wash out the bad nor a bad the good a lesson i've tried to teach my son does he listen to me put this in your mouth and lie down you don't want to watch gods no but if your red woman told him to leap from the crow nest she has a name i trust you've not forgotten your smuggler tricks i've lived within the law for 17 i want you to be a smuggler this time any shore any night what am i bringing ashore the red woman no one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again no you can't bite on it i am true to your grace and always will be but surely there are other ways cleaner ways cleaner ways don't win wars are you afraid onion knight someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors you've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time are you a good man ser davos seaworth i'd say my parts are mixed my lady good and bad if half an onion is black with rot it a rotten onion a man is good or he is evil if he ever gets out it better than biting your own tongue believe me and which are you oh good i'm a knight myself of sorts a champion of light and life well that must be very nice for you do you love your wife i do yet you have known other woman don't talk about my wife i'm not i'm talking about other woman like me ser davos you want me you want to see what beneath this robe what your name talisa and you will strange that this lord of light asks you to work in the shadows shadows cannot live in the dark ser davos they are servants of light the children of fire and the brighter the flame the darker they are these weren't here before they've barred the passage they can't bar our passage gods protect us there only one god ser davos and he only protects those who serve him your last name you want to know what side my family fights on you know my family name you have me at a disadvantage that boy lost his foot on your orders they killed my father that boy did the family he fights for do you think he friends with king joffrey he a fisherman son that grew up near lannisport loras tyrell he probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago i have no hatred for the lad that should help his foot grow back you'd have us surrender end all this bloodshed i understand the country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good king joffrey you're going to kill joffrey if the gods give me strength and then what i don't know we'll go back to winterfell i have no desire to sit on the iron throne loras tyrell he prettier than the queen so who will i don't know you're fighting to overthrow a king and yet you have no plan for what comes after first we have to win the war you never told me where you're from volantis volantis you're far from home the boy was lucky you were here he was unlucky that you were you're here to answer for your brother latest treasons i don't care about pretty he better with a sword than any of them your grace whatever my traitor brother has done i had no part you know that i beg you please ser lancel tell her of this outrage using some vile sorcery your brother fell on stafford lannister with an army of wolves thousands of good man were butchered after the slaughter the northman feasted on the flesh of the slain killing you would send your brother a message but my mother insists on keeping you alive 0 game of thrones s02e05 the ghost of harrenhal srt you swear it by the mother and in return for my son loyalty they are going to attack us we need to be ready no need to concern yourself over it the king is taking personal charge of siege preparations may i ask specifically what the king has in mind you may specifically or you may ask vaguely the answer will be the same it important that we talk about this it the king royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councillors in the morning i'll destroy my brother army it wildfire wildfire you wouldn't lie to me would you cousin no that a lie right there it is not a lie why would i lie tell me if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true do you think it will make jaime more likely to kill you or less likely when i tell him you're fucking her i mean i'm telling you the truth when that done the smart money would be on more likely she making wildfire but then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours the alchemists' guild is being commissioned i suppose there only one way to find out they have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults they are planning to launch it from the city walls into stannis' ships and armies please when did she tell you this baratheon and stark will fight their common enemy together i heard her talking with the pyromancer and the other night after i left her she went to meet him i swear to you swear to me on what on my life but i don't care about your life in the light of the seven by all that is holy and right i lancel lannister do solemnly vow all right all right enough even torturing you is boring just get out as they have done many times before oh lancel tell my friend bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me please kill me if anything should happen to lord tyrion it will be my pleasure your grace what is it i'm sorry about your brother your grace i wanted to let you know that people grieve for him fools love a fool i grieve for him as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be our two houses have always been close i need to speak to you about what i saw in that cave i thought i made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter your grace i i've never known you to need to hear a thing twice and i've never known you to hide from the truth you've come to lecture me on truth i've come to tell you that what i saw all my brother bannerman have come to my side except the tyrells who fled like cowards which is why i am begging you to reconsider this battle they won't be able to resist us now soon i shall be sitting on the iron throne nothing is worth what this will cost you not even the iron i'll hear no more about it take a company of man secure the perimeter when do we sail for king landing as soon as i've consolidated my troops we'll make short work of the lannisters' fleet once blackwater bay is cleared we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city negotiate a peace with your brother and will you bring lady melisandre with you that not your concern if you take king landing with her by your side the victory will be hers i never thought i'd have reason to doubt your loyalty was i wrong loyal service means telling hard truths oh truth again all right what the truth the hard truth she a foreigner preaching her foreign religion some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey negotiate with stannis what do you believe you won those bannerman from renly don't lose them to her we set out for king landing without lady melisandre and you lead the fleet into blackwater bay your grace i'm honoured but my time on the sea was spent evading ships not attacking them the other lords won't be happy most of those lords should consider themselves lucky i don't hang them for treason you heard him out there hard truths cut both ways ser davos i've got it i've got it so it that one there at the top on the right buy my fruit my lord fresh fruit stannis has more infantry more ships more horses what do we have there that mind of yours you keep going on about well i've never actually been able to kill people with it good thing i'd be out of a job what about your father my son has no interest in the iron throne i'd have better luck debating the wind he hasn't sent a raven in weeks he very busy being repeatedly humiliated by robb stark is timeconsuming we won't be able to hold the city against stannis not the way joffrey planning on holding it corruption yes we are swollen bloated foul brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten yes a rotten king please bring my terms to your son it hard to argue with his assessmant not after what he did to your birthday present the king is a lost cause it the rest of us i'm worried about now a dancing king prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey you have to admire his imagination he talking about you what demon monkey people think you're pulling the king strings i believe we are natural allies they blame you for the city ills blame me i'm trying to save them you don't need to convince me demon monkey yeah come on you're the crew of the sea bitch i'm your commander welcome stop stop your captain commands you to stop i hope he feels the same where are we headed captain the stony shore to raid their villages there'll be spoils in it for you and woman if you do your jobs well and who decides if we've done our jobs well i do your captain i have been reaving and raping since before you left balon balls captain don't reckon i've got much use for your ideas on how to do it don't reckon i've got much use for a captain at all i'm thinking i can do the job of captain real well myself together we could end this war in a fortnight all i need is a ship you wouldn't know where i could find myself a ship now would you you could do that take the ship head out on your own and i will hunt you down drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor stop we yield congratulations on your first command thank you kind of you to come see me off oh i'm not here for you i was just on my way to red harbor i've got 30 ships there nowhere to put them here no too narrow you'd better get out there wouldn't want her to set sail without you that would never happen my crew would wait on deck for a year if i asked them to this lot though enjoy the stony shore come on i'll take you out who are you dagmer your first mate why aren't you with the rest of them no or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea that would be good for a laugh they're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself and how am i supposed to prove myself by pillaging pisspoor fishing villages you're not and yet that the task my father has given me to prove that i'm a true iron islander they're all iron islanders do they do as they're told or do they do as they like the stony shore not far from torrhen square the seat of the house of tallhart follow me a more impressive prize than a few fisherman daughters what you don't think we could take it no we could we could never hold it for more than a few days as soon as winterfell got word that we'd taken torrhen square the starks would send their man to take it back and then take me to my ship the starks have overextended their lines now that summer over they'll have a hard time keeping their man and horses fed you'll die for this no wait it wasn't her the starks understand winter better than we ever will the cold won't beat them our spies report growing discontent among the northern lords they want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn and i'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampmants they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords this is war no one content we've underestimated the stark boy for too long he has a good mind for warfare his man worship him and as long as he keeps winning battles they'll keep believing he is king in the north we've got to leave you've been waiting for him to fail he is not going to fail not without our help so how do we stop him we've worked through the night my lord perhaps we'd profit from some sleep yes i think you would reginald and because you're my cousin i might even let you wake from that sleep go i'm sure your wife must miss you my wife in lannisport well then you'd better start riding then i see no reason for hostility between us they'll hang you for this go before i change my mind and send her your head if your name wasn't lannister you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook tent go not wine water we'll be here for some time girl where are you from maidenpool my lord and who are the lords of maidenpool remind me house mooton my lord now and what is their sigil a red salmon i think a maidenpool girl would remember that you're a northerner aren't you good one more time where are you from barrowton my lord house dustin two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown and what do they say of robb stark in the north they call him the young wolf i won't leave him and they say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf they say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants they say he can't be killed and do you believe them no my lord anyone can be killed fetch that water a girl says nothing a girl keeps her mouth closed you can't avenge him if you're dead no one hears and friends may talk in secret yes a boy becomes a girl i was always a girl and i was always aware but the girl keeps secrets it is not for a man to spoil them you're one of them now i should have let you burn and you fetch water for one of them now why is this right for you and wrong for me over there go i didn't have a choice you did i did and here we are a man pays his debts a man owes three three what the red god takes what is his lovely girl and only death may pay for life you saved me and the two i was with you stole three deaths from the red god not that way we have to give them back speak three names and the man will do the rest three lives i will give you no more no less and we're done i can name anyone and you'll kill him a man has said the one who tortures everyone we need to go home a man needs a name i don't know his name they call him the tickler that is enough go now girl your master is thirsty he not here yet he'd have seen us blown the horn when will he come the halfhand does things in his own time my uncle told me stories about him loras my lord my lady most of them are true i heard the halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall the whole winter he was north of the skirling pass when the snows came had to wait for the thaw so it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own well possible for the halfhand beautiful isn't it gilly would love it here there nothing more sickening than a man in love get out about time you did something at least you'll keep warm the fist of the first man think of how old this place is before the targaryens defeated the andals before the andals took westeros from the first man before i die please stop talking thousands and thousands of years ago the first man stood here where we're standing all through the long night what do you think they were like the first man stannis will be here in an hour stupid smart people don't find themselves in places like this i think they were afraid i think they came here to get away from something and i don't think it worked wildlings one blast is for rangers returning wildlings is two blasts so you got to stand there waiting wondering your son can go on calling himself king in the north when he arrives renly bannerman will flock to him one blast for friends two for foes and three for white walkers it been a thousand years but that the only time they blow the horn three times but if it been a thousand years how do you know well i read it in a book look it qhorin halfhand aye we'll live another day your former companions will fight for the privilege hurrah take care my lord i remember reading an old sailors' proverb "piss on wildfire and your cock burns off " oh i have not conducted this experimant it could well be true the substance burns so hot it melts wood stone even steel and of course flesh the substance burns so hot it melts flesh like tallow after the dragons died wildfire was the key to the targaryen power of selling you to their new king my companion takes issue if i could tell you how many crazy old man i've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit no offence meant our order does not deal in pig shit the substance is fire given form and we have been perfecting it since the days of maegor to do what the jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy how much do you have if you could get real soldiers to man the catapults and you want that privilege for yourself then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten but all the real soldiers are in the riverlands with your father my lord this man is insulting i don't know if you've ever seen a battle old man but things can get a bit messy 'cause when we're flinging things at stannis he flinging them right back at us man die man shit themselves man run which means pots falling which means fire inside the walls which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down you will note that i am standing here talking to you my friend remains unconvinced he would not dare insult my order whilst aerys targaryen lived well he not living any more and all his pots of wildfire didn't help him did they man win wars not magic tricks we have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so our present count stands at 7 811 enough to burn stannis baratheon fleet and armies both this is a shit idea not stannis i'm afraid i have to concur with my adviser wisdom hallyne the contents of this room could lay king landing low you won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer you'll be making it for me he'll be able to feed himself from now on let him sleep doreah yes khaleesi he loves you i rewove this part of the top and i fixed the heel on this one there no time for this thank you my friend did you see the dress xaro had made for you they say he the wealthiest man in qarth it is known and if qarth is the wealthiest city in essos the last time a rich man gave me a dress he was selling me to khal drogo may he ride forever through the night lands xaro is our host but we know nothing about him man like to talk about other man when they're happy you would look like a real princess in xaro ride back to highgarden sister she not a princess she a khaleesi you should wear it khaleesi you are their guest it would be rude not to and you must visit the night market the qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen it sounds wonderful the meereenis think they have a night market i will take you there myself please excuse me for a momant what are they doing i'm not running from stannis malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry kovarro says that malakko is an idiot they can pry out the gems the rest is pure gold very soft he can chop off as much as we can carry or melt it very simple we are his guests you can't pry it or chop it or melt it of course not khaleesi we will wait until we leave not even when we leave brienne of tarth murdered renly why not our host saved us from the red waste and you want to steal from him i will hear no more my brother used to say the only thing the dothraki knew how to do was steal things better man have built it not the only thing they're quite good at killing the better man that not the kind of queen i'm going to be mother of dragons on behalf of the warlocks of qarth i welcome you the starks will have dominion over all lands north of moat cailin i don't believe that a demonstration take this gem look at it into its depths so many facets look closely enough and you can see yourself in them often more than once should you grow tired of xaro baubles and trinkets it would be an honour to host you at the house of the undying you are always welcome mother of dragons you don't believe that my apologies pyat pree is one of the thirteen it was customary for me to extend him an invitation customs die slow deaths in qarth what is the house of the undying it is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening it turns their lips blue and their minds soft so soft they actually believe their parlour tricks are magic you watch over her who gained the most from our king death do i know you i know you jorah mormont of bear island who are you i'm no one but she is the mother of dragons she needs true protectors now more than ever they shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again and when they see they shall lust for dragons are fire made flesh stannis and fire is power it looked like stannis to me it just looked like a shadow in the shape of a man in the shape of stannis we should reach my son camp tomorrow will you stay there long my lady only long enough to tell robb what i have seen after that i will leave for winterfell my two youngest need me i will put a sword through his righteous face i've been away from them for far too long i never knew my mother i'm sorry my own mother died on the birthing bed when i was very young it a bloody business what comes after is even harder once you're safely back amongst your own people will you give me leave to go my lady you mean to kill stannis you can't stay here i swore a vow but stannis has a great army around him his own guards are sworn to keep him safe i'm as good as any of them i should never have fled renly death was no fault of yours you served him bravely i only held him that once as he was dying he gone brienne he would have been a true king you serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth renly enemies are robb enemies as well i do not know your son my lady but i could serve you if you would have me you have courage not battle courage perhaps but i don't know a woman kind of courage and i think that when the time comes you will not hold me back promise me that you will not hold me back from stannis when the time comes i will not hold you back a good king then i am yours my lady i will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that i swear it by the old gods and the new i vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that i shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonour i swear it by the old gods and the new and it not just thieves my lord there wolves in them hills now more than i ever seen tell me ser loras they come down in the night and they kill my sheep my three sons is away fighting for your brother my lord they'll fight keep fighting till they're told to go home i have no one to man my flock now only me i can't keep watch all day and all night we can send two orphan boys from winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board my wife always prayed for more children we'll look after them thank you my lord what do you desire most in this world and may the gods bless you and yours stop it if that everyone i'm going to go for a ride before dark good hodor hodor ah lord stark torrhen square is under siege torrhen square is barely 40 leagues from here how can the lannisters strike so far north might be a raiding party led by the mountain might be sellswords paid by tywin lannister provided he swears me an oath of fealty revenge we have to help them most of the fighting man are away with robb but i can gather 200 decent man do you need so many if we can't protect our own bannerman why should they protect us go ser rodrik take the man you need won't take long my lord southerners don't do well up here so what does it mean ask your maester luwin he the one studying books all the time i did ask him he'd never heard of a threeeyed raven must not mean anything then i have always found that to be the purest of motivations you're lying you might be a little lord but don't you call me a liar you know what it means i never said i didn't you didn't give me an honest answer that not the same as being a liar well it not far off so you've been dreaming of a threeeyed raven again in the godswood you told me you didn't dream now who a liar what did you see in your dream but you won't have a chance to put your sword through stannis something bad tell me boy i dreamt that the sea came to winterfell i saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls it flooded the castle drowned man were floating here in the yard ser rodrik was one of them the sea is hundreds of miles away not today i know it just a stupid dream i've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen otherwise they'll put me in chains again osha the threeeyed raven what do they say about it north of the wall they say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall there where on that mountain i don't see very well you'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground a fire there a fire the people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine when they see us coming that fire becomes a signal gives mance rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honour how many wildlings have joined him from what we can tell all of them mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves they're almost ready to make their move where somewhere safe if it is justice that you want be smart about it somewhere south can't just march into their midst and we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us you saying we should fall back to the wall mance was one of us once now he one of them he going to teach them our way of doing things they'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back they're gonna be more organised than before more disciplined more like us you can't avenge him from the grave so we need to be more like them do things their way sneak in kill mance and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the wall and to do that we need to get rid of those lookouts it not a job for 400 man i need to move fast and silent harker stonesnake borba lord commander i'd like to join lord qhorin i've been called lots of things but that might be my first lord qhorin you're a steward snow not a ranger bring the horses i've fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that he the one aye you killed a wight you also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword craster in the boy defence that a tough old goat i could take up jon duties while he gone my lord it would be no trouble well i hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward please go on so tell me how long has your manservant been in love with you he not my manservant and he not in love with me he my adviser my friend unlikely i can almost always tell what a man wants and what about what a woman wants much more complicated he was very handsome you for example what do you want to cross the narrow sea and take back the iron throne why because i promised my khalasar i'd protect them and find them a safe home you want to conquer the seven kingdoms for the dothraki i want them because they're mine by right the iron throne is mine and i will take it ah a conqueror and how did you get all of this did someone give it to you and the wording of this oath he was your grace no i come from nothing i hit the docks like a piece of cargo except someone normally cares what happens to cargo so you wanted more than you had and you took it you're a conqueror too you're just less ambitious what do you want xaro xhoan daxos at the gates of the city you bled for me why i will show you why the door and the vault is made of valyrian stone the hardest steel does not make a mark "your grace " i offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it i made the same offer to the greatest thieves they all went home emptyhanded the only thing that can open this door is this key and behind the door and it can all be mine all let us say half more than enough to buy horses ships armies enough to go home calling yourself king doesn't make you one all i have to do is marry me that was a romantic proposal i've already married once for love but the gods stole her from me i come from nothing my mother and father never owned a pair of shoes but marry me and i will give you the seven kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses see i have more ambition than you thought and if renly wasn't a king i wasn't a queen the time is right daenerys targaryen first of your name robert baratheon is dead if you cross the sea with an army you bought the seven kingdoms are at war with one another four false kings destroying the country to win westeros you need support from westeros the usurper is dead the starks fight the lannisters and baratheons fight each other according to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand the time to strike is now we need to find ships and an army do you want to be a queen or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world rich man do not become rich by giving more than they get they'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever moving carefully is the hard way but it the right way and if i'd listened to that advice outside the gates of qarth we'd all be dead by now i know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have but you must do not speak to me like i'm a child i only want what do you want tell me no to see you on the iron throne why you have a good claim a title a birthright but you have something more than that you may cover it up and deny it but you have a gentle heart you would not only be respected and feared you would be loved someone who can rule and should rule centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world there are times when i look at you and i still can't believe you're real so what would you have me do as my adviser i want to be the queen make your own way find your own ship you only need one the allies we need are in westeros not qarth and how do i get the ship i'll find it for you a sound ship with a good captain i look forward to meeting him khaleesi you should stand sideface sideface killed by whom sideways why smaller target am i fighting someone you're practising for a fight you should practise right guards did you see anything go up there go and see where he fell from go up the battlemant accounts differ move away stand back he dead most seem to implicate catelyn stark in some way the same ned stark swore to robert 18 years ago really who'd have thought some say it was one of his own kingsguard while still others say it was stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour whomever did it i say well done it not what varys says he says renly army is flocking to support stannis which would give stannis superiority over us on both land and sea littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one and i say father raised you to have too much respect for money cat their friendship held the kingdoms together stannis baratheon is coming for us sooner rather than later aren't there other things you should be doing like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away she'll be safer in dorne yes i know how concerned you are for her safety it so happens that i am myrcella is a sweet innocent girl and i don't blame her at all for you so clever aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots schemes and plots are the same thing 0 game of thrones s02e06 the old gods and the new srt i've taken your castle where hodor i don't know they'll never respect you while he lives ser rodrik i sentence you to death no you said no harm would come to them if i yielded the old man couldn't keep his mouth shut i urge you not to make a hasty decision he disrespected me in front of my man that was his decision not mine he is worth more to you alive than dead the starks will pay find the halfwit please theon think what you do you'll address me as prince theon or you'll be next come no no theon rodrik he who passes the sentence should swing the sword i'm begging you coward stop stop stop right now my man are bringing your people together in the courtyard you don't give commands any more little lord please stop this please stop him hush now child i'm off to see your father you said no harm would come you said no harm would come theon please any last words old man gods help you theon greyjoy now you are truly lost theon please don't do something i'll do anything please why so you and i can go down and tell them no please stop it ghost stay with us ghost there goes your pet he not a pet no you're right he not you can't tame a wild thing you can't trust a wild thing ghost is different so you think wild creatures have their own rules how you've yielded winterfell to me i won't their own reasons and you'll never know them now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night i thought you said you couldn't know wild things i said you can't they find a nice cave to hide in while the sun up and do their killing when it dark we could do the same no we couldn't yes you will this is their country they know where to walk where not to walk i've lost good man who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it my father always said i'm of the north i wasn't joking look around boy this look like home to you you start thinking you know this place it will kill you you understand me no you don't we're at war i won't i'll never yield we've always been at war it never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy we're fighting the north and it not going anywhere the watch has given you a great gift you only have one thing to give in return your life i'll gladly give my life i don't want you to be glad about it i want you to curse and fight until your heart done pumping and know this boy your death will be a gift for them south of the wall we'll fight you and throw you out they'll never know what you've done they'll never know how you died they won't even know your damn name but they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the wall gave his life for theirs now do you understand me i do you're even dumber than you look it just words boy to keep us a little warmer in the night make us feel like we've got a purpose the castle is mine come on we've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us can you read my lord can you read this letter detailing our infantry movemants was meant for lord damon of house marbrand it was sent to lord marlyn of house dormand my apologies my lord i must have girl fetch me the history of the greater and the lesser houses it the one on this but these people are still yours my cupbearer can read better than you to whom does house dormand owe allegiance my lord i to the starks of winterfell who have 20 000 man and my son i judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants i see i overestimated you if you ever put my son life at risk again i'll leave us put the book away girl theon it prince theon now you'll yield to keep them safe maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it lord petyr baelish mmm give us the room clear all this lord tywin baelish wine thank you what news from the capital i travelled here directly from renly baratheon camp ah the late king renly to keep them alive rather a short reign murdered by a woman i hear so they say there has been talk of other forces at work dark forces here man love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel it is my belief that a momant of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after you say that as if you were the first man alive to think it yes a crisis is an opportunity that what a good lord would do what other brilliant insights have you brought me today after the lannisters and the starks the tyrells command the largest host their lands are the most fertile in the seven kingdoms feeding horses and soldiers yes yes yes the tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings loras wants revenge he blames stannis for renly death and margaery wants to be queen yes she does house tyrell rebelled against the iron throne think carefully about what you want to say against my grandson they did and perhaps that treason should be punished one day after stannis and robb stark are defeated more wine for lord baelish if you will allow me to represent your family interests i believe that an advantageous agreemant the tyrell host has returned to highgarden they have pardon my lord theon it only wine you would ride there yourself tonight with your leave i'll have an answer by nightfall that'll be all girl and what else on your son tyrion directive i met with catelyn stark why he had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters did you hate us the whole time hmm a girl a wildling we could question her you could she won't answer i've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking what your name ygritte she was reaching for this axe when you got to her give her half a chance she'll bury it in your face i gave you my name i've yielded winterfell to theon i'm jon snow you ought to burn them you killed we'd need a big fire for that tell me ygritte why do you want us to build a big fire are there some more friends in the area burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again our boy

mountains what in the frostfangs your king could want do you mean to march on the wall do you know who i am girl qhorin halfhand tell me true if your people captured me say prince theon would they

winterfell i serve the starks i didn't do it for you he shouldn't make me wait the spice king is the second wealthiest man in qarth he makes everyone wait of course you could have avoided this embarrassmant if you married the wealthiest man in qarth i already have a husband khal drogo is gone khaleesi you are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful if you think you can hold the north with it shut up and you are far too smart to think that i will succumb to flattery i have travelled very far in my life and met many woman but none that are immune to flattery the mother of dragons here he comes forgive me i had terrible dreams last night terrible dreams i could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing if you serve me as loyally as you served ned stark look what a beauty you are now the red waste has been washed off you i am sorry about all that unpleasantness the silver hair of a true targaryen xaro xhoan daxos she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself very true and yet they say that your grandfather who sold pepper off the back of a wagon married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself every lady alive was lovelier i will be as good to you as he ever was steady and higher born than my grandfather did my servants not offer you something to eat to drink i'll have them flogged in the square thank you my lord you are a gracious host but there is no servant alive that can bring me what i want oh she has a talent for drama this one so my little princess what is it you want my birthright the seven kingdoms of westeros i fear i'm no better than a servant in this regard betray me and you will wish you hadn't i cannot give you what i do not have i'm not asking you for the kingdoms i'm asking you for ships i need to cross the narrow sea i need my ships as well i use them you see to bring spices from one port to another whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when i retake the iron throne retake did you once sit on the iron throne maester luwin send a raven to pyke my father sat there before he was murdered but if you did not sit on it yourself would it not be correct to say "take the iron throne" i didn't come here to argue grammar of course not you came to take my ships so let me explain my position little princess unlike you i do not have exalted ancestors i make my living by trade and i judge every trade on its merits you ask for ships informing my father of my victory here you say i shall be repaid triple i do not doubt your honesty or your intentions but before you repay your debts you must seize the seven kingdoms do you have an army not yet you do not have an army do you have powerful allies in westeros there are many there that support my claim when were you there last i left when i was a baby and one to deepwood motte to my sister so in truth you have no allies the people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when i return ah forgive me little princess but i cannot make an investmant based on wishes and dreams now if you'll pardon me do you know illyrio mopatis magister of pentos yes we've met a shrewd man for my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs he believed the world believed that the ages had turned them to stone inform her that she to bring 500 man to winterfell how many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies but i dreamt that if i carried those eggs into a great fire they would hatch when i stepped into the fire my own people thought i was mad but when the fire burned out i was unhurt the mother of dragons do you understand i'm no ordinary woman my dreams come true you are a maester of the citadel i admire your passion but in business i trust in logic not passion i'm sorry little princess i am not your little princess i am daenerys stormborn of the blood of old valyria and i will take what is mine with fire and blood i will take it yes my lady but not with my ships who taught you to read my father my lord i took it i'm occupying it sworn to serve the lord of winterfell are you not hmm i taught my son jaime to read the maester came to me one day told me he wasn't learning he couldn't make sense of the letters he reversed them in his head the maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it ha after that i sat jaime down for four hours every day until he learned he hated me for it for a time i am for a long time but he learned hmm where is your father is he alive who was he a stonemason a stonemason who could read hmm he taught himself quite a man i am the lord of winterfell as bran just informed you what killed him loyalty you're a sharp little thing aren't you did forgive me my lord i shouldn't ask questions no but you've already begun did you know your father my lord i did i grew up with him send the ravens i watched him grow old he loved us he was a good man but a weak man a weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name i'm cold i'll fetch more wood for the fire my lord mmm where are you going girl the armoury my lord my lord why lord tywin sent me what might this be lord tywin gave it to me what for to take to the armoury why would he do that let go and ask him move get out of the way amory lorch my lord greyjoy a girl has named a second name a man will do what must be done now a girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing a man cannot make a thing happen before its time but he going to tell tywin he getting away it has to be now guard your grace your grace my honour your grace i see you've finally learned how to address your betters your grace your grace quent lady talisa your grace i'm not sure i'm a lady westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me it hard to keep all the rules straight but if i remember my lessons a woman of noble birth is always called a lady unless she a queen or a princess what do you want i could find someone who knows why are you so sure i'm of noble birth because it obvious what if i told you my father sold lace on the long bridge and my mother my brother and i lived with him above our shop i'd call you a liar not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty i always thought i was a brilliant liar better at amputations i'm afraid quite a pretty spot i was brought here a captive will we be here long i couldn't really discuss troop movemants with you i'm not a spy of course a spy would deny being a spy you're right you've found me out i'm writing a letter to the lannisters "the young wolf is on the move " perhaps you'd join me if you've got time of course for well robb mother you were here the day i was taken mother this is lady talisa she been helping with the wounded she been very helpful lady talisa lady stark lady talisa maegyr maegyr forgive me i do not know this name an uncommon name here an old name in volantis excuse me my lady your grace i've missed you i sent man over the walls with grappling claws and ropes i'm the one who took you what of it yes you look positively forlorn you surprised me that all i didn't think i'd see you today i wish that you were free to follow your heart i know you have inherited your father responsibilities i'm afraid they come at a cost you are promised to another i know a debt that must be paid i haven't forgotten your grace my lady let me serve you news from winterfell your brothers desert you i can tell you which way to go we'll stop here too dark to go any farther today here there no shelter here there no shelter anywhere there is if you know where to look the cold could kill us both if you light a fire no fire serve me how but a fire is no fire have it your way we'll stay warmer if we stay close bet you freeze to death before i do bet your life think they're out looking for you yes think they'll find you yes you're brave stupid i need fighters not kitchen sluts but brave we start again at first light get some sleep stop moving i'm just trying to get comfortable stop it you're still moving was i i didn't notice that time this cannot be true we've had ravens from white harbour barrowton and the dreadfort it was robb stark who put me in the kitchens i'm afraid it is true why why would theon because the greyjoys are treasonous whores my brothers we've heard nothing of them but rodrik cassel is dead i told you never trust a greyjoy i must go north at once there still a war to win your grace how can i call myself king if i can't hold my own castle how can i ask man to follow me if i can't you are a king put a spear in my hand again and that means you don't have to do everything yourself let me go and talk to theon there will be no talk he will die for this theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew let me send word to my bastard at the dreadfort he can raise a few hundred man and retake winterfell before the new moon we have the lannisters on the run if you march all the way back north now you'll lose what you gained my boy would be honoured to bring you prince theon head tell your son bran and rickon safety is paramount so you can bury it in my neck do you take me for a fool and theon i want him brought to me

farms let them know what it means to choose the wrong side mmm is that mutton yes my lord don't like mutton i'll bring something else leave it are you hungry no of course you are eat get the horses

this will be my last war come on find the scent win or lose have you ever lost before do you think i'd be in my position if i had lost a war but this is the one i'll be remembered for the war of five kings they're calling it my legacy will be determined in the coming months do you know what legacy means it what you pass down to your children and your children children it what remains of you when you're gone harren the black thought this castle would be his legacy where they going the greatest fortress ever built the tallest towers the strongest walls the great hall had 35 hearths thirtyfive can you imagine look at it now a blasted ruin do you know what happened dragons yes dragons happened halt harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land a million man could have marched on these walls and a million man would have been repelled but an attack from the air with dragon fire mmmmmm harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls aegon targaryen changed the rules that why every child alive still knows his name 300 years after his death aegon and his sisters mmm enjoying your first hunt it wasn't just aegon riding his dragon it was rhaenys and visenya too correct a student of history are you rhaenys rode meraxes visenya rode vhagar i'm sure i knew that when i was a boy visenya targaryen was a great warrior she had a valyrian steel sword she called dark sister hmm so far hunting seems very similar to riding my lord she a heroine of yours i take it aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs jonquil with the flowers in her hair most girls are idiots you remind me of my daughter where did you learn all this stuff about visenya and her valyrian steel sword from my father he was a wellread stonemason can't say i've ever met a literate stonemason have you met many stonemasons my lord with hunting there blood at the end careful now girl i enjoy you but be careful take that back to the kitchen eat what you want and girl "m'lord " lowborn girls say "m'lord " not "my lord " if you're going to pose as a commoner you should do it properly my mother served lady dustin for many years my lord you let a cripple escape they're little boys she taught me how to speak proper properly you're too smart for your own good has anyone told you that yes go on i beg pardon ser i should have come to you after to thank you for saving me you were so brave brave a dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats does it give you joy to scare people no it gives me joy to kill people i was a little boy when i was torn away from my home and brought here spare me you can't tell me lord eddard stark of winterfell never killed a man it was his duty he never liked it is that what he told you he lied killing is the sweetest thing there is why are you always so hateful you'll be glad of the hateful things i do someday when you're queen and i'm all that stands between you and your beloved king i've demanded a meeting of the thirteen one of them did this or knows who did so i kept my word i never ran away you are one of the thirteen if i wanted your dragons i would have taken them they mean nothing to me on their own nothing they're more valuable than anything in the world shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me i cannot buy already we will get them back there is no we so why would you help me get them back i took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city a man is what others say he is and no more if i find them soon enough i won't hurt them if they say that xaro xhoan daxos is a liar my word is worth nothing i cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof but it did happen under your roof khaleesi many times in my life i have been i don't care where you've been you think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles we can't make steel as good as yours it true but we're free if someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman we'd shove a spear up his arse well i'll hurt them but i won't kill them we don't go serving some shit king who only king because his father was no no you serve mance rayder the king beyond the wall we chose mance rayder to lead us he was a crow same as you but he wanted to be free you could be free too you don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old man wake up when you want to wake up i could show you the streams to fish the woods to hunt build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead you're a pretty lad the girls would claw each other eyes out to get naked with you walk i could teach you how to do it i know how to do it you know nothing jon snow and what did she say she admired your spirit your grace and what then she they have no value to me missing if every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative ser alton we'd all hang she tore the paper in half your grace you've acted with honour i thank you for it lord karstark see that ser alton pen is clean and give him a hot supper ser alton pen is occupied your grace the prisoners from the yellow fork too many prisoners is there room for ser alton robb will have sent a force to retake winterfell by now does he need to lie down have the man build him a new pen put him in with the kingslayer for now have your boy watch over them torrhen that will be all your grace a minute of your time i've been treating your wounded man and my enemies as some of my bannerman are fond of mantioning robb in the riverlands my sister in deepwood motte they're not my enemies that what i tell my bannerman i've already run through the supplies i brought with me some are easily replaced egg yolks turpentine oil of roses but some are not i need silk for stitching i need fennel root for those with fever willow bark mostly i need milk of the poppy you saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any i assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over if you need help finding these i know where to find them she'll get here long before they do i'm sorry i shouldn't interrupt you continue my lady you're riding to the crag to negotiate a surrender yes the crag will have a maester and he will have what i need i expect he will if i could write a list come with me to the crag i don't think that will be let the maester show you his stores the boy can't walk but somehow he slipped past you and ned stark always said 500 man could hold winterfell against 10 000 i want the wounded man to be treated well all the wounded man children come inside quick come on hurry up can't find anything ser they've lost the scent try again we've circled this farmhouse twice there no sign of them we could start the search fresh in the morning my lord i'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people we have a scent ask yourself is there anything i wouldn't do to stop that from happening the hounds will find the scent again i'll beat them until they do i'll whip every man here until i have both those boys in hand and once i've got them the pampered little shits it better to be cruel than weak prince theon where are they who m'lord the stark boys where are they i don't know i seen no one think harder the hounds have the scent i swear m'lord i don't know my lord over here i think i've found what we're looking for send the old man home go back to winterfell take him back theon don't do this you came back as soon as i heard do you know anything irri is dead i know come maester don't look so grim she was a good she dead she died alone she died for me and i couldn't protect her doreah we can't find her she must be dead too i led my people out of the red waste and into the slaughterhouse i should have been here you went to find me a ship my place is by your side i shouldn't have left you alone with these people it all just a game "these people" they are not to be trusted and who is to be trusted who are my people the targaryens i only knew one my brother and he would have let a thousand man rape me if it had got him the crown the dothraki most of them turned on me the day that khal drogo fell from his horse your people are in westeros we should have took more food the people in westeros don't know i'm alive they will soon enough and then what they'll pray for my return they'll wave dragon banners and shout my name that what my brother believed and he was a fool you are not your brother trust me khaleesi there it is "trust me " and it you i should trust ser jorah we couldn't risk going to the kitchens only you i don't need trust any longer i don't want it and i don't have room for it you are too young to be so and you are too familiar forgive me khaleesi no one can survive in this world without help no one let me help you please tell me how find my dragons how long till we get back to your crows those people all love you they would have given you whatever you needed we're close what a day a halfday you don't know do you do you even know where they are we're close what do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me nothing happened between you and me "i swear it old master king crow ser "we were only close together for warmth "and then i felt it right up against me backside like a club "i can show you the bruise on me tailbone and if theon found out he'd hang them "and before i knew what was where his his "well it was all out in the open all angry as you like "and i didn't want to want it but oh i did "and he spread me legs and ruined "the shame of it "now i can never marry a perfumed lord "what will me poor savage father say" turn back around "and i thought that we were done but he said "'turn back around "' the boy can't survive on walnuts i'm fine i'll tell you what jon snow since it gonna be your word against mine and since you can't talk about it without blushing we may as well just what right here in the muck i'll keep you warm enough are you that afraid of it that enough it nice and wet the giant must have took him we've been walking since before sunrise and warm enough it don't have teeth all right all right gods you're dull should have took me while you had the chance no no no oh no it all right give me that even hodor will tire hodor if the queen sees i can have joffrey children now help me flip it over where are you going to tell her grace you'll say nothing to anyone do you understand your mother might have prepared you you flowered my dear no more my mother told me but i thought it would be different in what way i thought it would be less even you sweet giant hodor less messy wait until you birth a child you're a woman now do you have any idea what that means i'm fit to bear children for the king a prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world the greatest honour for a queen joffrey has always been difficult even his birth i laboured a day and a half to bring him into this world you cannot imagine the pain wait i know that farm i screamed so loudly i was sure robert would hear me in the kingswood his grace was not with you robert was hunting that was his custom whenever my time was near my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsman and his hounds and when he returned he would present me with some pelts or a stag head and i would present him with a baby not that i wanted him there mind you i had grand maester pycelle an army of midwives and i had my brother i sent those two winterfell orphans there when they told jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out joffrey will show you no such devotion you may never love the king but you will love his children i love his grace with all my heart that so very touching to hear permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day the more people you love the weaker you are jack and billy you'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do you'll act the fool to make them happy to keep them safe love no one but your children on that front a mother has no choice but shouldn't i love joffrey your grace you can try little dove who did you say your mother was again cinda lannister is she the fat one they'll give us some food we can't risk it well perhaps she gotten a little larger than she no no there only one fat lannister if she was your mother you'd know it i squired for you once you know when the tournamant the day of willem frey wedding i went to willem frey wedding you did your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up he threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds what was his name if theon tracks us here he'll torture them until he finds out where we are bryan poor lad that was my brother doing i seem to recall i remember you you'd never squired for anyone before that right i ran up and volunteered "let me my lord let me " my father was furious afraid i'd embarrass our family in front of the family you didn't though you really remember billy climbs a tree better than anyone you knew when you were needed and when to go away it a rare talent most of my squires they mean well but young man with big jobs they tend to overdo them when i think back to that day shh you were saying i never mind it embarrassing more embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit i remember everything about that day your helmet your horse you've never seen me climb a tree little man the rake lines in the dirt along the list where the sun was in the sky when you knocked balon swann from his horse and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me i'll remember it all until i die that was the best day of my life and i remember being on the field after it was over all the competitors were done i was the last one out there and i couldn't leave i couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride the giant they'll be after us with hounds and i couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when i knew that they could never have the faintest idea what i was talking about i understand completely how could you sorry i i didn't mean to doubt you it just that i i was 16 once i also had to replace someone squire on short notice which knight was it barristan selmy the fight against the kingswood outlaws before your time we got a good start on them but we can't outrun hounds forever what was he like he was a painter a painter who only used red i couldn't imagine being able to fight like that not back then and to help him do that to be a part of something that perfect i don't need to explain how that felt not to you it hard to put into words it like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember did you pull a knife on me in the night and finding out that the dream is more real than your life leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison did you squire for him again no i didn't have your gift he couldn't take a step without stepping on me i was awful a complete liability until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16yearold squire it a good thing i am who i am what the matter i'd have been useless at anything else i'm not wellsuited for imprisonmant shocking i know some man are ned stark i imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end not me though my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint and have you thought about of course every day can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman arse and good prisoners breed good jailers apparently the starks are very careful but there is a way i think it wasn't possible until now what is it it actually quite simple well let me help you you'll only have to do one thing tell me you'll have to die let move jorah the andal this man must sail past old valyria all who travel too close to the doom must have protection i didn't come here for lessons no you came for the dragons you have them where are they draw your sword see what your steel is worth you want to please the mother of dragons it is the first time you love her where are the dragons will you betray her again jorah the andal will you betray her again never the thief you seek is with her now i did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief no one is calling you a thief who is she to accuse us how old are you boy please they're my children i'm begging you begging us it wasn't very long ago you were threatening us without me the dragons will die it will be for the best your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery my dear if i knew where they were i would not tell you you are cruel my friend the mother of dragons is in the right she must be reunited with her babies i will help you khaleesi how i'm a man of the night watch i will take you to the house of the undying where i have put them you have my dragons when i learned you were coming to our city i made an arrangemant with the king of qarth he procured them for me but there is no king of qarth there is now that was the other half of the arrangemant you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls but qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change i will open qarth to the world as i have forced it to open itself to me your ambition is an inspiration you're a boy who never been with a girl but like all upstarts you overreach three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king an upstart and a charlatan empires have been built by less those on the margins often come to control the centre and those in the centre make room for them willingly or otherwise the mother of dragons will be with her babies she will give them her love and they will thrive by her side forever hodor don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets a mother should be with her children where will you run to daenerys stormborn your dragons wait for you in the house of the undying come see them lady stark no farther keep your hands off me woman don't enter without an invitation man forgive me lady stark what is it they caught the kingslayer kingslayer don't call them that kill the fucking kingslayer hang him hang him you'll die today justice for the karstark gut him get back i want his head any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death lord karstark this man is our prisoner this monster killed my son and crippled mine what stones he will answer for his crimes i promise you but not here i will have his head and if you try and stop me you will strike me down have you forgotten me ser i am the widow of your liege lord eddard stark i am the mother of your king and where is our king now you know very well he has gone to the crag to accept the surrender aye gone to the crag but not to negotiate he brought that foreign bitch with him how dare you or bone threatening my lady is an act of treason treason how can it be treason to kill lannisters i understand your grief my lord better than most i understand it but in the name of my son the king in the north stand down when your son returns i will demand this murderer head wise man do not make demands of kings fathers who love their sons do i will have his head thank you for fighting on my behalf lady stark neither i would have come to your defence but take him to the stockades bind him with every chain you can find you've become a real shewolf in your later years there not much fish left in you and gag him since when do you light your own candles since i decided that i can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant how many times can you read one raven scroll stannis baratheon fleet has been spotted sailing north past tarth 200 ships both more than we have yes that more than we have he'll be at our gates within five days four if he has the wind we have strong high walls we'll rain fire down on them from above "rain fire on them from above " you're quoting father aren't you why not he has a good mind for strategy doesn't he call it tactics not strategy but yes he does have a good mind for it the best mind some would say sadly he not here move it just you me and joffrey the lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm i'm sure you'll make a point eventually he needs to start acting like a king this war you started is coming to our doorstep and if the entire city wants joffrey dead i'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse i thought the girls might help him did you i was wrong if we can't control him i heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them do you think i haven't tried he doesn't listen to me it hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head i always hoped he'd be like jaime he looks like him in a certain light the boy is more robert than jaime robert was a drunken fool but he didn't enjoy cruelty sometimes i wonder what of course maybe that just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them if this is the price for what we've done for our sins sins the targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years i know that what jaime and i would say to each other in our momants of doubt it what i told ned stark when he was stupid enough to confront me half the targaryens went mad didn't they what the saying as if i'd feel sorry for them "every time a targaryen is born the gods flip a coin " you've beaten the odds tomman and myrcella are good decent children both of them then why wait we're sworn to the king there not a king that treason so is saving lannisters yeah back off you no i won't your son returns at dawn my lady so they say the kingslayer won't last the night oh that all right then are there no girl crows the more they drink the angrier they'll get and when the karstarks draw their swords who wants to die defending a lannister come he'll not be making it through the night i need to be alone with him my lady our orders your orders which i just gave you are to leave me alone with him come to say goodbye lady stark i believe it my last night in this world there are no woman of the night watch no is that a woman do you hear them out there they want your head old lord karstark doesn't seem to like me you strangled his son with your chains oh oh was he the one on guard duty he was in my way any knight would have done the same you are no knight you have forsaken every vow you ever took so the lads just do it with each other so many vows they make you swear and swear defend the king obey the king obey your father protect the innocent defend the weak but what if your father despises the king what if the king massacres the innocent it too much no matter what you do you're forsaking one vow or another where did you find this beast she is a truer knight than you will ever be no kingslayer kingslayer what a king he was here to aerys targaryen the second of his name lord of the seven kingdoms protector of the realm and to the sword i shoved in his back you are a man without honour do you know i've never been with any woman but cersei so in my own way i have more honour than never never poor old dead ned what was the name of that bastard he fathered brienne no that wasn't it snow a bastard from the north now when when good old ned came home with some whore baby did you pretend to love it no you're not very good at pretending you're an honest woman you hated that boy didn't you we swore an oath how could you not hate him the walking talking reminder that the honourable lord eddard stark fucked another woman your sword i told you what would happen all of you i told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not what are you doing what have you done you have sheep at the wall if there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says here is the answer to your question no with your hands then no wonder you're all so miserable would you please shut up would you please shut up you let a halfwit escape with a cripple you think you're better than me crow i'm a free woman you're a free woman i might be your prisoner but i'm a free woman if you're my prisoner you're not a free woman that what "prisoner" means and you think you're free you swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl it was my choice to say the words so you don't like girls of course i like girls but you chose never to touch them that the price you pay if you want to be a man of the night watch and rickon too the little one so instead of getting naked with a girl you'd prefer to invade our lands invade your lands wildlings raid our lands all the time some of them tried to kill my little brother a crippled boy they're not your lands we've been here the whole time you lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours my father was ned stark i have the blood of the first man my ancestors lived here same as yours 0 game of thrones s02e08 the prince of winterfell srt riders approaching open the gate you treated them with honour by butchering them he was the best man i ever met i know children always think that about their fathers but children do not always think that about their fathers believe me he once told me that being a lord is like being a father except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them the farmers ploughing the fields are yours to protect the charwoman scrubbing the floors yours to protect the soldiers you order into battle he told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night i didn't believe him before i had to kill them i asked him "how can a man be brave if he afraid" "that is the only time a man can be brave " he told me i wish i could have met him he would have liked you most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwoman scrubbing their floors he didn't care much about gold or glory and you you think i'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me i want to go home i want the man following me to go home then why don't you i treated them you seized their home as is your right because we'll never be safe until the lannisters are defeated and because i believe in justice chopping off joffrey head you mean that would be a start your grace milady the kingslayer he escaped in the night how how tell me this isn't true why for the girls we're ironborn we take what we need you betrayed me robb no you knew i would not allow it and you did it anyway bran and rickon are captives in winterfell sansa and arya are captives in king landing i have five children and only one of them is free i lost one son fighting by your son side i lost another to the kingslayer strangled with a chain you commit treason because your children are prisoners i would carve out my heart and offer it to the father exactly if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell i grieve for your sons my lord i don't want your grief i want my vengeance and you stole it from me killing jaime lannister would not buy life for your children but returning him to king landing may buy life for mine jaime lannister has played you for a fool you've weakened our position you've brought discord into our camp and you did it all behind my back then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away make sure she guarded day and night robb how many man did we send in pursuit of the kingslayer forty your grace send another 40 with our fastest horses robb damn you're much uglier in daylight what your name i'm jaime lannister of casterly rock son of tywin a captive knight has a right to know his captor identity is that treachery brienne of tarth tarth tarth tarth crescent moons and starbursts lord selwyn tarth your father do you have any brothers and sisters my lady it a long way to king landing might as well get to know one another have you known many man i suppose not woman i'd call it bravery horses ah i didn't mean to give offence my lady forgive me your crimes are past forgiveness kingslayer why do you hate me so much have i ever harmed you you've harmed others those you were sworn to protect the weak the innocent has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly you will not provoke me to anger i already have look at you you're ready to chop my head off they made me a promise your little boy prisoners made you a promise do you think you could do you think you could beat me in a fair fight i've never seen you fight the answer is no there are three man in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me you're not one of them all my life man like you have sneered at me and all my life i've been knocking man like you into the dust if you're so confident unlock my chains let see what happens do you take me for an idiot in and you got mad when they broke it i took you for a fighter a man pardon woman of honour was i wrong you're afraid maybe one day we'll find out kingslayer king landing will fall an hour after stannis lands his force it not too late for king joffrey and cersei and the court to ride west to safety surrender the iron throne better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates stannis will execute them all why it the prince of winterfell are you the dumbest cunt alive no a king who runs will not be king for long he a lannister he'll stand and fight stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep the scouts assure us robb stark remains north of ashemark ha the last time the scouts assured us of stark movemant he lured us into a trap which is why my son is his prisoner too close to casterly rock he sent a splinter force to recapture winterfell the greyjoys have done us a great favour don't call me a cunt stark won't risk marching on casterly rock until he at full force he a boy and he never lost a battle he'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid we'll ride at nightfall i want a full night march before he knows we're on the move clegane you'll maintain a garrison here at harrenhal track down this brotherhood and destroy them the girl has proven herself a good servant she'll stay on with you a dumb cunt who killed the only two starks in winterfell see that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings he poor company when he sober but he better at his work you've got some questions to answer who killed ser amory i don't know please give me the name take this one out for the crows i told you i don't know please look it yoren little cunt used to be a boy now it a girl where jaqen you know how valuable those boys were don't care where your stick now bitch i promised to fuck you with it come on time to kill some wolves you need sour cherries to make it right and the secret is you dry the stones and then you break them with a mallet that where the real flavour is you crush 'em up real fine and then when you're finished you sprinkle them over the piecrust where jaqen how would i know i need him now if i hadn't killed them the northerners would think me weak lord tywin marching tonight you need him he helping me i saw him where where where ow they went riding out the gates a few hours ago on patrol let go of my ears what do you want with him anyway mance is gonna march on the wall when he does one brother inside his army will be worth 1 000 fighting against it you are weak and you're stupid they'll never trust me they might if you do what needs to be done what how does it feel knowing those man all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl i didn't i should have known better trusting a traitor bastard he not yours to kill crow do you have to do that here i like to keep me hands clean yes but do you have to do it here i'm warning you you should start wearing the gold cloak i don't want to wear a gold cloak you're commander of the city watch you shouldn't be dressed like a common a cloak slows you down in a fight makes it hard to move quietly and the gold catches the light so you're nice and easy to spot at night well you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer you're supposed to stand out we had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it fine fine go on then warn me no gold cloak what what what what why are you staring at me you don't want me cleaning me nails you don't want me looking your way why am i here to help me plan the defence of king landing stannis will be here any day and one of these explains how to beat him "an history of the great sieges of westeros " you haven't brought enough man by archmaester shevelathin shevelatesh chevalteesh i'd swap all your books for a few good archers my lord hand commander i must complimant you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery i did not know and how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery how am i supposed to defend winterfell with just this lot me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves for questioning no it just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now we talked about this aye we talked about it have you ever been in a city under siege maybe this part not in your books see it not the fighting that kills most people it the starving food worth more than gold noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes envy isn't attractive what envy you're not things get bad enough the poor start eating each other the thieves they love a siege soon as the gates are sealed they steal all the food by the time it all over they're the richest man in town given the circumstances my lord i believe extreme measures are warranted ah "the great sieges of westeros " thrilling subject shame archmaester ch'vyalthan wasn't a better writer stannis knows king landing i've come to bring you home father wants a word he knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest the mud gate a good ram will batter it down in minutes and it only 50 yards from the water that where he'll land and if stannis does attack the mud gate what is our plan we could throw books at his man we don't have that many books is this a joke we don't have that many man either what do we have pig shit i'm not cut out for this sort of work i always imagined meself doing something much worse we're digging latrine pits at the end of the world i can't imagine anything much worse you lack imagination where do you think jon is right now he went off with the halfhand he didn't come back winterfell is the heart of the north a betting man would go with dead he not dead no jon a great fighter well he better than me and a lot better than you he got a valyrian steel sword so did his father and qhorin halfhand is the greatest ranger alive great rangers never get old is the problem shit ones neither it them in the middle that last a long time aye it is hundreds of miles from the sea what in seven hells is that the first man made these marks help me with it look if you find something you're not supposed to best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it that a night watch cloak it been here a long time oh must be dragonglass we're islanders baby brother had you forgotten that dragonglass the maesters call it obsidian why would a brother hide it here i expect it 'cause he wanted somebody to find it mind where you're going i'm sorry i'll where were you a man has patrol duty tywin lannister was right here and now he gone a girl owes one more name our power comes from our ships the red god demands it give the man a name how long after i give you the name does it take you to kill someone a minute an hour a month death is certain the time is not he taking his army to attack my brother i need him dead right now this a man cannot do you promised you'd help me help was not promised lovely girl only death and now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the stark boys there must be others give a name any name and you'll kill them anybody by the seven new gods and the old gods beyond counting i swear it all right jaqen h'ghar a girl gives a man his own name that right gods are not mocked this is no joking thing i'm not joking every man in the north wants to see you hanged a man can go kill himself unname me no please i'll unname you thank you if you help me and my friends escape this would require more than one life this is not part of our bargain fine jaqen h'ghar a girl lacks honour if i do this thing a girl must obey a girl will obey when robb stark finds out he won't find out a girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight thank you podrick odd little boy i have a certain sympathy for odd little boys you and varys both excellent lamprey pie were you slaving away in the kitchen all day i hear joffrey plans on fighting an inspiration for the troops the young king in his shining armour you should be proud of your brother achievemant we've killed all the ravens fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel he only a boy younger boys are off fighting his war he not ready what is he 17 remember jaime at 17 better than you some man have a gift for this sort of thing some don't his place is not on the battlefield it not on the throne either sadly for all of us we have all the horses do you think i'm an idiot no i'd say you possess aboveaverage intelligence you shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die he'll have his kingsguard protecting him he has the finest armour gold can buy he needs to be out there the man will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother skirts any dessert i've taken winterfell do you know why varys is so dangerous because he has thousands of spies in his employ because he knows everything we do before we do it because he doesn't have a cock neither do you perhaps i'm dangerous too you on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man that little worm between your legs does half your thinking it not that little why are you smiling and i will keep winterfell because i'm happy and why are you happy because i have your little whore i thought you preferred blondes such a droll little fellow tell me have you married this one yet no good father will be so pleased why do you care who i fuck because a lannister always pays her debts leave us you stole my only daughter you plot to have joffrey killed this is madness stannis will be here in days you need me for what your skill in battle pretty thing your whore lovely body the bruises will heal in time where did you find her varys isn't the only one who hears whispers theon you're my blood really a lannister lion necklace you need to hide your secret whores more carefully you've forgotten the most important thing about whores oh well you're the expert tell me you don't buy them you only rent them you're usually a better liar baby brother this one you like you like her very much we both loved our mother could it be love don't worry she'll be treated gently enough unless joffrey is hurt and then every wound he suffers she'll suffer too and if he dies there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt and how do i know you haven't killed her already would you like to see her i thought you might ser mandon bring in my brother whore we both endured our father i'm sorry they hurt you you must be brave i promise i will free you don't forget me never i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you're safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid get out come home with me don't die here alone shae i've been waiting all night what is wrong you're beautiful then why do you look sad we have to be more careful don't be afraid i can take care of myself there are people who want to hurt me i know i won't let them i'll cut off their faces i will i don't intend to die i would kill for you do you know that i expect i'll have to before this is over you're mine i'm yours promise me i'm yours and you are mine still no word we've sent a dozen ravens none have returned my bastard is only a few days from winterfell once he captures the castle theon has my brothers i took the great castle of winterfell with 20 man you were a terrible baby do you know that if we storm the castle he wouldn't dare hurt the boys they're his only hope of escaping the north with his head send word to your son any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes a touch of mercy is a virtue your grace too much any ironborn with the exception of theon greyjoy he betrayed our cause he betrayed me and we will hunt him down no matter where he runs i expect his countryman will turn on him the minute they hear the offer bawling all the time never sleeping your pardon my lord your grace my lady how are you how am i i've had to arrest my mother the lannisters have my sisters the man i considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers i'm fighting a war and i don't know if i should march south or north i'm sorry it was a stupid question i'm sorry and one night you just wouldn't shut up no forgive me you're being kind i have no right you have every right you're a king that not the kind of king i want to be what kind do you want to be i don't know the good kind most kings grew up as princes screaming like a dying pig they spend their whole lives preparing for the crown i was raised to be lord of winterfell i was raised to be a proper little lady to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite valyrian poetry i'd like to hear you play the harp no no you would not how did you go from reciting valyrian poetry to sawing off man feet when i was 12 my mother and father went to a wedding i walked over to your crib i looked down at you weddings in volantis last for days you know and they left me with my little brother the second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the threeyear summer we couldn't bear to be inside so we ran down to the rhoyne every child in volantis was in the rhoyne that day the rich the poor we were all there naked screaming racing to the little islands drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank i was treading water talking to a friend i wanted to strangle you when i realised i hadn't seen my brother i called his name then i started screaming his name and then i saw him floating face down my heart just stopped i was i dragged him from the water my friend helped me i think i don't even remember and you looked up at me and you stopped screaming he was so little then we pulled him onto the riverbank and i screamed at him and i shook him and he was dead just dead a man ran over he had a fish tattoo on his face in volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them and this man worked on a fishing boat you smiled at me and he pushed me out of the way you have to understand for a slave to push a highborn girl that death for the man a terrible death but he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brother chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the rhoyne and cried out and the man cradled his head and told him to be calm i decided two things that day don't die so far from the sea i would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies and when i came of age i would never live in a slave city again i'm sorry your grace you told me of your problems and i've blathered on i don't want to marry the frey girl i don't want you to marry her but you needed that bridge i hope it a very beautiful bridge the sour cherries was all crushed up and ready i've brought you a present lord of bones shut up probably in the piecrust by now in the oven the nice warm oven shut up what did you bring the cheese could be better i did get some nice sausages what did he want us to do about those guards he didn't say he just said "walk through the gates " what about the guards you're a great warrior i already got one crow don't need two he didn't say anything about the guards what he left that bit out it a pretty important part don't you think we have to trust him trust him you trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran i want to go back to the kitchens shut up stay here if you're afraid arry don't away mance will want to question this one reset if the wind holds we'll reach king landing in a day will it hold can't make promises for the wind your grace again pull i admire you ser davos i thank you your grace pleased to hear it some highborn fools call you onion knight and think they insult you so you take the onion for your sigil sew it on your coat fly the onion flag knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning my son wishes me to change it three merman with tridents something like that i understand why the older families look down at me do you why my father was a crabber and well sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers our hands stink and where were those lords when storm end starved many fought bravely for your brother many fought for the mad king the halfhand knows more this one is just a little boy you defend these man who insult you behind your back some are happy to do it to my face we were forgotten robert and ned stark they were the heroes the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle liberating towns from the yoke of the mad king while i held storm end with 500 man no one has forgotten your grace no robert did he gave storm end to renly after the war renly never fought a day in his life he was only a boy then why'd he give him storm end gut him first we ate the horses we weren't riding anywhere not with the castle surrounded we couldn't feed them so fine the horses then the cats never liked cats so fine i do like dogs good animals loyal but we ate them then the rats the night before you slipped through i thought my wife was dying she couldn't speak any more she was so frail and then you made it through the lines slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions he could have killed me half a dozen times and potatoes some salted beef i believe every man in storm end wanted to kiss you that night i was relieved they did not robert told me to hold storm end so i held it then he told me he was giving it to renly so i gave it up insult or no i gave it up because robert was my older brother and he was the king and i've always done my duty but now i'm the rightful king by every law of westeros and when i sit the iron throne you'll be my hand and now he wishes he did your grace i pray i serve you well i expect you'll be the first crabber son to wear the badge you're the master of whisperers you're supposed to know everything no man can be in all rooms at all times i have many little birds in the north my lord but i haven't heard their songs since theon greyjoy captured winterfell the stark forces are distracted now is the time to strike to strike my dear nephew you do see these man preparing the walls for siege gut him you do understand stannis baratheon sails this way if my uncle stannis lands on the shores of king landing i'll ride out to greet him a brave choice your grace i'm sure your man will line up behind you they say stannis never smiles i'll give him a red smile from ear to ear imagine stannis' terror i am trying he a bastard of winterfell ned stark son you're an intelligent man i'd like to think i'm an intelligent man oh no one disputes that my lord not even the multitudes who despise you i wish we could converse as two honest intelligent man i wish we could too what do you want tell me if we're going to play you'll have to start my brother was the youngest kingsguard in history my sister became queen at the age of 19 mance will want him when i reached manhood my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in casterly rock a most highborn plumber the water never flowed better and all the shit found its way to the sea i never expected to have any real power so when my father named me acting hand you're quite good at being hand you know jon arryn and ned stark were good man honourable man i saw the bodies above your gates what does mance want with a dead man bastard but they disdained the game and those who played you enjoy the game i do last thing i expected and you play it well i'd like to keep playing it if stannis breaches the gates the game is over they say he burns his enemies alive to honour the lord of light the lord of light wants his enemies burned the drowned god wants them drowned why are all the gods such vicious cunts i don't know where is the god of tits and wine in the summer isles they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats we should sail there immediately this morning i heard a song all the way from qarth beyond the red waste daenerys targaryen lives a girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems she has three dragons but even if what they say is true it'll be years before they are fully grown i think he'll want to decide for himself and then there will be nowhere to hide one game at a time my friend careful khaleesi xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you i found one a ship with a good captain she leaves for astapor tomorrow astapor we cannot stay here they have my dragons a mother does not flee without her children he runs i'll chop his balls off they're not your children i know they call you the mother of dragons and i know you love them but you didn't grow them in your womb they didn't suckle at your breast they are dragons khaleesi and if we stay in qarth we'll die you should sail to astapor i'm sure you'll be safe there you know i would die for you i will never abandon you i'm sworn to protect you to serve then serve me he runs i'll do it meself if my dragons are in the house of the undying then take me there that what the warlock wants he told you so himself if you enter that place you will never leave again his magic is strong and what of my magic you saw me step into the fire you watched the witch burn what did the flames do to me do you remember until my last breath i will remember after i have forgotten my mother face they are my children we're even now jon snow and they are the only children i will ever have take me to them we should bury them i'd leave 'em up a few more days sends a message if they haven't got the damn message yet a few more days won't help as you say but it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer what this gold for the farmer for his trouble his troubles are done i couldn't do it he feeding the crops now his wife too you want to keep a man silent you silence him got as far as the farm and then doubled back walked through the stream to throw off the hounds hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look you're right so far who was that out there hung up at the gates must have been the farmer boys i had the sword on her neck i just couldn't he killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords they mustn't know bran would blame himself they'll never hear it from me the little lads have suffered enough i know the others which one gave you the tougher fight the cripple or the sixyearold when you didn't come back we went looking for you we found your tracks fast enough but they found us before we found you they died because of me see that it wasn't for nothing all right up lad come on on your feet now move it is she beautiful i've never met her i treated the stark boys with honour and they repaid me with treachery what her name frey i suppose i don't know her first name i'm sure you'll be very happy and you're marrying her for a bridge an important bridge ah it was before they killed my father i still thought i could march south and rescue him in time but only if i crossed that bridge when i speak to people from the north they all loved your father 0 game of thrones s02e09 blackwater srt that it and you're not a smuggler any more you're the high captain it warm in here we've got beautiful woman and good brown ale plenty for everyone and all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no woman to keep us company oh there woman in the ground i put some there myself so have you of course there are several royal fleets at the momant you like fucking and drinking and singing but killing killing the thing you love you're just like me only smaller and quicker eh your lord imp going to miss you aye not after tonight i expect he will someday here we are one more drink before the war shall we i've always hated the bells they ring for horror a dead king a city under siege a wedding exactly podrick is that it "is that it" nice touch when the sun rises stannis will sit on the iron throne as if you don't know the name of every boy in town i'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting i'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what i'm suggesting do you trust him oddly enough i do good the map you asked for there must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city closer to 50 the targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and you will be his hand and to provide escape if necessary i'm not escaping strange as it sounds i'm the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down i go with her that is good to hear though i'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat you look well suited for battle my lord well i'm not for all our sakes i hope you are wrong my little birds tell me gods be good god that stannis baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from asshai what of it you don't believe in the old powers my lord blood spells curses shapeshifting what do you think i think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen you probably don't entirely trust me mmm don't take it personally i don't entirely trust myself and yet i have seen things father there is only one and he watches over us and heard things things you have not things i wish i had not i don't believe i've ever told you how i was cut no i don't believe you have one day i will the dark arts have provided lord stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door for a man in service to such powers to sit on the iron throne i can think of nothing worse and tonight but not over them over all of us i believe you are the only man who can stop him they're welcoming the new king i've never known bells to mean surrender they want to play music with us let play drums drums remember wait till the ships the ships are in the bay they must be far enough in i know what "in" means do you know how to use that i chopped wood once no i watched my brother chopping wood the people of king landing did not choose the false king joffrey baratheon i saw you kill a man with a shield you'll be unstoppable with an axe don't get killed nor you my friend oh are we friends now of course we are just because i pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship enhances it really oh "enhances " fancy word for a sellsword been spending time with fancy

when i return and taste my uncle blood will you slay him yourself if stannis is fool enough to come near me so you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard a king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls our ships outnumber theirs 10to1 i'm sorry your grace you're right i'm stupid of course you'll be in the vanguard they say my brother robb always goes where the fighting is thickest and he is only a pretender your brother turn will come then you can lick his blood off hearteater too some of those boys will never come back joffrey will the worst ones always live shh come my lady our army outnumber theirs 5to1 where our fleet on the way why isn't it here now they're coming hound tell the hand that his king has asked him a question the king has asked you a question ser lancel tell the hound to tell the king that the hand is extremely busy the hand of the king would like me to tell you to tell the king if i tell the hound to cut you in half he'll do it without a second thought that would make me the quarterman it just doesn't have the same ring to it those walls have never been breached cut me in half and i won't be able to give the signal no signal no plan no plan and stannis baratheon sacks this city takes the iron throne puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere it might be quite amusing except that my head would be up there too i've never much liked my head but i don't want to see it removed just yet where are their ships it was wise to attack at night we took them by surprise and the man guarding the walls lord varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago there are no surprises here if it true there is dissension in their ranks maybe their sailors have mutinied maybe i don't know why she wants me here she always saying how

a stolen horse and some gold cups i have faith in the lord of light the battle first traitors have ser ilyn see to them put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning the only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy remember that if you ever hope to become a queen you said he was here to protect us he is traitors are a danger to us

her here sit drink not like that drink girl i'm a lannister i should have been born a man i'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens they are your guests under your protection you asked them here it was expected of me as it will be of you if you ever become joffrey queen if my wretched brother should somehow prevail these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them lifted their spirits i don't have a choice in all this and if the city should fall you'd like that wouldn't you the red keep should hold for a time long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to lord stannis in person if it were anyone else outside those gates i might have hoped for a private audience but this is stannis baratheon i'd have a better chance of seducing his horse have i shocked you little dove tears aren't a woman only weapon but it not your war the best one between your legs learn how to use it drink do you have any notion

tullys it their dungeons you rot in why not kill him for stealing a pig i don't give the orders he must be important to someone sending him with you how important could he be all right have it your way my lady lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm do i know you have you been to ashemark no then you don't know me do you ever go to the river market at salt rock is it near ashemark no i've never been there what do you think of these beauties i hope you gave them quick deaths two of them we did yeah wait i do know you do hereby proclaim my grandfather that jaime lannister i wish someone had told me i wouldn't have had to steal that pig if this is the kingslayer i think i'd know about it how do you know what the kingslayer looks like i was at whispering wood i saw him they dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king he not the kingslayer sorry to disappoint you if he was i'd only be travelling his head i have a question for you both and i want you to answer it at the same time pod tywin lannister the saviour of the city and the hand of the king i count to three you both answer what his name one two three two quick deaths those were stark man i

mean to do it anyway i love her i know that seems important to you it is important to me your father didn't love me when we married he hardly knew me or i him love didn't just happen to us we built it slowly over the years lord petyr baelish step forward stone by stone for you for your brothers and sisters for all of us it not as exciting as secret passion in the woods but it is stronger it lasts longer and that is what would be in store for me with one of walder frey daughters what you and father had why not because she not beautiful because she not exotic and exciting now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it for your good service and ingenuity and you agreed to it you gave him your word treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same if your father lived his life for one thing my father is dead and the only parent i have left has no right to call anyone reckless you said you saw my victory in the flames i did i still see it the flames lied and i'm no better than a savage in uniting the houses of lannister and tyrell trusting in a fire god i fought for your god in blackwater bay i led my man to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive and for what attacked from behind by tywin lannister and the tyrells if you see so much in your flames why didn't you warn me the lord of light only allows me glimpses you claimed to speak for a god will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle you talk about war as if you understand it i declare that you shall be granted the castle of harrenhal i've been fighting far longer than you have you show me how you fight show me where your god now will he save you where is your god inside you i murdered my brother we murdered him with all its attendant lands and incomes share the weight with me he wasn't your brother this war has just begun it will last for years thousands will die at your command you will betray the man serving you you will betray your family you will betray everything you once held dear and it will all be worth it because you are the son of fire to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time you are the warrior of light you will sweep aside this pretender and that one you will be king you promise these things but you don't know none of us know let me show you look into the fire my king look i see fire keep looking you

hornblowing cunt before i fall they want you to know you're surrounded i know i'm surrounded i know that because i stood on the battlemants i shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons and saw i was surrounded they don't want you to sleep they want to sap your spirit before thank you wise bald man thank you for explaining siege tactics to me no word from my father no send more ravens you killed all the ravens the first time i saw winterfell find bronn or varys ser loras tyrell first time i saw winterfell it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after i was dead i saw it and i thought "of course ned stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers "we never stood a chance against the man who lives here " lord stark went out of his way to make it your home yes my captors were so very kind to me you love reminding me of that everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that you know what it like to be told how lucky you are to be someone prisoner your house has come to our aid to be told how much you owe them and then to go back home to your real father i will kill that man i swear to the drowned god the old gods the new gods to every fucking god in every fucking heaven i will kill that man theon listen to me i serve winterfell now winterfell is yours i'm bound by oath to serve you the whole realm is in your debt none more so than i and what your counsel trusted friend run five hundred northman wait outside the walls you have 20 man you can't win wait for nightfall and run there nowhere to run i'd never make it back to the iron islands and even if i did even if by some miracle i slipped through the lines and made it home i'd be a coward the greyjoy who ran if your family would ask anything of me ask it the shame of the family don't go home join the night watch once a man has taken the black he beyond reach of the law all his past crimes are forgiven i won't make it to the wall i won't make it 10 feet past the winterfell gates there are ways hidden passageways built so the lords of winterfell could escape and it shall be yours the road will be dangerous but with a little luck the night watch is an ancient honourable order you'll have opportunities there the opportunity for jon snow to cut my throat in my sleep the opportunity to make amands for what you've done i've done a lot haven't i things i never imagined myself doing i've known you many years theon greyjoy you're not the man you're pretending to be your grace not yet you may be right but

ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland aye you think they're right aye my sister margaery her husband was taken from us before we die today brothers we die bleeding from 100 wounds with
