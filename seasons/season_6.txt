dead i'd like to see my brother confess please how is he at least tell me that confess i am the queen and i demand to see my brother <i>sinners</i> <i>don't make demands </i> they make confessions septa unella our other guests need you there who killed him septa unella can be overzealous at times i'll speak with her my brother can you tell me how he is it isn't ser loras that brings me here your husband misses you dearly the love between a man and wife is sacred it reflects the love the gods have for all of us but sin leads us away from the sacred and only confession can purge sin i have nothing to confess i did so you believe you are pure perfect wholly without sin none of us are you have started down the path but you have many miles to go i always envied oberyn he lived he truly lived sailed around the world and bowen marsh and othell yarwyck fought man from every country lay with the most beautiful woman alive and man and man he experienced everything while i sat here in dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed but that is life we each have our roles oberyn was born to be an adventurer and i was born to rule and the other officers in this castle the gods are not fools you would have been a lousy adventurer and oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler your mother is a brilliant woman you know that <i>prince doran </i> the princess myrcella when was the last time you left this palace you don't know your own people <i>their disgust for you </i> murderers traitors elia martell raped and murdered and you did nothing oberyn martell butchered

a boy anymore because you have no cock she thinks you want to eat her baby mhysa means mother in valyrian <i> i know what mhysa means </i> who wrote it hard to know jon snow was my lord commander our queen is not as popular in meereen as she used to be the sons of the harpy very possibly daenerys targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings weren't even property to begin with you can see why they're unhappy of course it could also be the freed man many of the former slaves feel that daenerys has abandoned them she did fly away on a dragon and not come back <b><font

can't fight an enemy we don't know the sons of the harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully which means they take orders from someone and have you started looking for that someone my little birds have already taken wing that was no secret soon they'll return singing songs of man in gold masks well we won't be sailing to westeros anytime soon goat ram you think our friend got him don't know anything else that can melt a ram horn we're on the right path then perhaps she tired of being queen i don't think she likes it very much she too smart to like it but i never once disobeyed an order maybe she flown somewhere else somewhere far away from man like us i've been all over the world there no escaping man like us there no escaping her eh you keep coming back why you know why isn't it frustrating wanting someone who doesn't want you back of course it is loyalty is the foundation you're a romantic i admire that sometimes i look at you and i think "so that what

so the fleet it been burned we are searching for the man who burned the ships but nobody saw anything surely there some good news lurking somewhere astapor and yunkai have stopped asking us for aid perhaps they can tell us their secret the masters have retaken both cities outside of meereen the whole of slaver bay has returned to the slavers what about the dragons we have two of them here beneath the pyramid they are not eating they haven't touched any food since queen daenerys left benjen always lifts his chin when he about to charge daenerys is the dragon queen can't very well let the dragons starve that obvious if a dragon does not want to eat how do you force him to eat dragons do not do well in captivity how do you know this that what i do i drink and i know things the dragons aegon used to conquer westeros ranged over hundreds of miles then daenerys ancestors started chaining them up in pens and lowers it when he going to dodge my lady a few generations later the last dragons were no larger than cats they must be unchained or they'll waste away missandei how many times were you in the company of these dragons many times and did they ever harm you never dragons are intelligent more intelligent than man according to some maesters they have affection for their friends hodor talks and fury for their enemies i am their friend do they know that they will it time they had their supper i'm friends with your mother i'm here to help don't eat the help when i was a child an uncle asked what gift i wanted for my name day i begged him for one of you "it wouldn't even have to be a big dragon " i told him you leave the fighting to the little lords wylis "it could be little like me " everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago i cried myself to sleep that night but here you are next time i have an idea like that punch me in the face what your name what your name come

nothing at all why do i want to return so i can be a cripple again <i>so i can talk to an old man in a tree</i> you think i wanted to sit here for 1 000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me so why did you i was waiting for you i don't want to be you i don't blame you the lord let you come back for a reason you won't be here forever you won't be an old man in a tree <i>but before you leave </i> you must learn learn what everything _ _ _ _ stannis was not the prince who was promised _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ but someone has to be _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ could you give us a momant _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i don't know how you stand it in all that leather you were dead if we could have the room you look lovely today my dear you really do how you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat if you're going to torture me just call them back and get on with it i am not a torturer though it so often is what people deserve and it does provide answers but they're usually the wrong answers my job is to find the right answers easy easy and now you're not do you know how i do that i do it by making people happy i'd like to make you happy vala that your name isn't it vala that all right i know who you are and what you've done you've done a lot you've sacrificed your body for a cause which is more than most people do and you've helped the sons of the harpy that completely fucking mad seems to me murder the unsullied and the second sons the unsullied and the second sons are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history i understand well that makes perfect sense from your perspective i have a different perspective of course i think it important that you try to see things from my perspective just as i will try to see them from yours i can only imagine how it seems to you because that is the only way that i can make you and dom happy that is how you pronounce it dom i'm afraid i don't really speak the language such a handsome boy those big brown eyes good luck keeping the ladies away yes you're a true liberator aren't you you won't torture me you'll just threaten my son children are blameless i have never hurt them i did what i thought was right your boy is in no immediate danger this i swear to you but between us dear you did conspire to kill the queen soldiers we both know the penalty for that crime how will poor dom get on without his mother and with his breathing problem if i tell you anything they'll kill me so either you kill me or they do yes from your perspective this is a problem and i got murdered for it there is a third option though a ship leaving tomorrow for pentos i've already booked passage for a woman and her young son i'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again though i'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leatherclad friends back in to carry it far too heavy for me the boat sails at dawn you need to decide now a new life for you and dom and now i'm back or what should we do while we wait to pass the time what should we do <i>what should we talk about</i> you speak 19 languages you must occasionally use some of them to talk about things you two you spend a great deal of time together what would you be talking about if i weren't here patrol when i am going on patrol with the unsullied why what we see on patrol who we captured on patrol that good that very good but that a report i was thinking more of a conversation a wise man once said the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms who said this me just now i don't know all right no conversations let play a game you don't play games either one of you ever games are for children <i>my master kraznys</i> would sometimes make us play games there that a start only the girls no no no not that of course not that innocent games fun games maybe we'll never know drinking games <i>we do not drink </i> until you do all right no drinking we can play without drinking it a wonderful game i invented it here how it works i make a statemant about your past if i'm wrong i drink and if i'm right what does it matter maybe we can't play without drinking oh you took your time sorry i was busy learning who funds the sons of the harpy some things you can't rush you found out the good masters of astapor and the wise masters of yunkai with help from their friends in volantis <i>you see</i> you don't even have to worry about the local rebellion easy you go on we only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it we conquered astapor and yunkai once we will do it again and execute the masters if the unsullied march off to reconquer astapor and yunkai who will remain to defend the free people of meereen if we do not fight them how can we stop them we cannot the masters speak only one language they spoke it to me for many years you fight for as long as you can <i>i know it better than my mother tongue </i> if we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them may it be the last thing they ever hear you may be right <i>so we will fight them</i> possibly possibly it a conversation tell me can your little birds get a message to the good masters of astapor the wise masters of yunkai and benevolent enslavers of volantis you clean up as much of the shit as you can of course man can be fickle but birds i always trust your eye looks much better arthur how your mother jaw better and your father no one seen him and no one will that worked out rather nicely will lord varys ever come back i don't know how to do that i don't think so do you miss him he was nice he called us his little birds he gave us sweets it funny you should mantion that guess what i happened to find today candied plums from dorne now remember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me i thought i did but all i need in return are whispers <i>no need to be afraid </i> this is ser gregor he friends with all my friends run along now varys little birds your little birds now your grace what did you do to him exactly i haven't been able to get a clear answer oh a number of things i failed does he understand what we're saying i mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place he understands well enough so tell him to march into the sept and crush the high sparrow head like a melon the high sparrow has hundreds of faith militant surrounding him ser gregor can't face them all and he won't have to he'll only have to face one good has the faith leveled official charges yet not yet that is one trial by combat i look forward to watching don't stop at the city i want little birds in dorne in highgarden in the north if someone is planning on making our losses their gains i want to hear it if someone is laughing at the queen who walked naked through the streets covered in shit now go fail again i want to hear i want to know who they are i want to know where they are <i>as bad as lord varys was qyburn is worse </i> i told them all i told them he arrogant dangerous you don't get thrown out of the citadel without good reason and no one listened to my advice <i>so here we are </i> and what he done to gregor clegane they think you're some kind of god <i>is an abomination </i> we never sanctioned this experimant i for one think it will be in our best interest to have the beast dest can i help you why are you here my mother i was invited my dear to help deal with several troublesome issues such as the queen imprisonmant thank you for bringing it up it well past time we addressed the abuses i endured the man who returned from the dead margaery is the queen you are not the queen <i>because you're not married to the king </i> i do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family this is a small council meeting you have no position on the small council i'm the lord commander of the kingsguard the lord commander of the kingsguard does have a position on the small council what do you remember i'm not a god grand maester pycelle would you sanction that statemant well um i would say ser gerold hightower had a seat on the mad king council <i>of course that was the mad king </i> king robert saw things differently and king what about myrcella death uncle do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue i know that the same woman who murdered myrcella have overthrown house martell and taken control of dorne we've got a lot to discuss all of us together and seeing as you cannot make us leave we best get on with it no we cannot make you leave and you cannot make us stay not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all your grace my mother would like to see her daughter final resting place i saw your pecker i'm sorry your grace that not possible not yet when will it be possible when she fully atoned for her sins you cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city that wasn't the full atonemant no she must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extent of her sins what kind of god would have a pecker that small i want you to let her see myrcella resting place i am the king you are and what does that mean to you <i>it means a great deal to me </i> the crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world <i>do you know who told me that</i> your mother my mother who is unclean your eyes are still brown my mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through how do you think the mother above first came to us how did man and woman first come to feel the mother presence hmm it was through their own mothers there a great deal of falsehood in cersei you know that but when she speaks of you the mother love outshines it all her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn't come from this world is that still you in there but you know that you've felt it you've seen her when she talks to you yes <i>it a great gift </i> one i never had envy one more thing for me to atone for your grace do you may i do you mind i think so it my knees of course when your mother made her walk of atonemant she did it to get back to you i still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she already endured it not what i want it what the gods want <i>they make their will known to us and it up to us</i> to either accept or reject it please hold off on burning my body for now if we're to be just and good then we accept it all of us even kings a true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can and no one is wiser than the gods my grandfather once said something similar except for the part about the gods the gods worked through him whether he knew it or not as they work through your mother there so much good in all of us the best we can do is to help each other bring it out that funny who are you no one <i>who were you before you came here</i> <i>arya stark </i> <i>tell me about arya stark family </i> her father was eddard stark her mother was catelyn stark she had one sister sansa and four brothers three brothers you sure that still you in there <i>robb bran rickon </i> and a halfbrother jon and where are they now <i>they may be dead for all a girl knows </i> tell me about the hound <i>also dead </i> <i>arya stark left him to die he was on her list </i> he was not on her list anymore she had taken him off it why didn't she want him dead any longer they stabbed me you all right <i>she did and she did not </i> she sounds confused yes she was who else was on arya stark funny little list <i>cersei lannister </i> <i>gregor clegane </i> <i>walder frey </i> <i>that a short list </i> <i>that can't be everyone you want to kill </i> are you sure you're not forgetting someone yes yes i'm fine which name would you like a girl to speak <i>if a girl tells me her name </i> i will give her eyes back a girl has no name come if a girl is truly no one <i>she has nothing to fear </i> who are you no one the umbers are a famously loyal house did i ever tell you i used to think the sea was called the see famously loyal to the starks and you lord karstark your people share blood with the starks don't they but here we are times change when my father became warden of the north <i>your house refused to pledge their banners </i> your father was a cunt my beloved father the warden your father was a cunt and that why you killed him <i>i might have done the same to my father</i> because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own my father was poisoned by our enemies mmm why have you come to winterfell lord umber the bastard jon snow led an army of wildlings past the wall we're farther north than any of you fuckers <i>wildlings come down we always have to fight them first </i> i like fighting wildlings been doing it all my life but there are too many of them for us to beat back alone so now you've come seeking help i don't think so we need to help each other the colder it gets the farther south those goat fuckers will roam won't take them long to get here you think a horde of wildlings can take winterfell if they get jon snow leading them maybe <i>he knows this place better than we ever will </i> pledge your banners to house bolton swear loyalty to me as warden of the north and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends sea see i'm not kissing your fucking hand traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord i'm not doing that either why would i trust a man who won't honor tradition your father honored tradition <i>knelt for robb stark </i> called him king of the north <i>was robb stark right to trust your father</i> then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse fuck kneeling and fuck oaths they're spelled different but they sound the same i've got a gift for you a girl i hope i prefer redheads a girl aye <i>a wild one </i> i like them wild and the boy nice and young the way karstark likes them who this rickon stark how do i know that rickon stark yeah they do welcome home lord stark it time if you have any last words now is the time you shouldn't be alive it not right neither was killing me my mother still living at white harbor could you write her tell her i died fighting the wildlings i had a choice lord commander it was before i learned how to read obviously betray you or betray the night watch you brought an army of wildlings into our lands an army of murderers and raiders if i had to do it all over knowing where i'd end up i pray i'd make the right choice again i'm sure you would ser alliser i fought i lost now i rest but you lord snow you'll be fighting their battles forever sam are you going

was and yet not long ago we received reports that she has been married to ramsay bolton in winterfell on our way to the fingers we were set upon by a large force of bolton man seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting do you take me for a fool tell me lord royce i did everything i could you know that how many people knew of my travel plans with sansa stark i shared my intentions with you <i>and no one else </i> slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him your home is the vale the lord of the vale stands before us and only his judgmant concerns me <i>shall we throw him</i> <i>through the moon door</i> my lord my lord i have always been faithful to house arryn you swore a vow to your father to your mother and now to you do you believe him uncle petyr lord royce has served the vale well he enjoyed a distinguished military career if we could trust his absolute loyalty he would make a capable commander in the wars to come you can trust my absolute loyalty my lord i think he deserves one more chance what do you say fine i bring good news aye i pledged my life to the night watch my friends in the north tell me sansa has escaped winterfell i expect she headed to castle black where her brother serves as lord commander but she won't be safe there not with the boltons after her she my cousin we should help her that was my instinct as well our lord has spoken gather the knights of the vale the time has come to join the fray i gave my life for all nights to come <i>you invite the enemy</i> <i>into our city</i> i did as a clever man once told me "we make peace with our enemies not our friends " i don't make peace with the queen enemies i kill the queen enemies yes that the military approach and how has that worked here in meereen i represent the diplomatic approach our queen tried to make peace with the masters they killed me edd my own brothers and they tried to murder her we enter these negotiations with open eyes trust me my own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution how many days were you a slave long enough to know not long enough to understand i bought this dwarf for a single gold honor and somehow you've risen to the top of the great pyramid of meereen you want me to stay here after that it most impressive and now you speak for the good masters of astapor here to reversals of fortune we came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch let make this simple shall we tell me what you want we want you to leave slaver bay take your dragons and your mercenaries and go queen daenerys won't stay in meereen forever her path takes her westward <i>riders approaching</i> when we last met i offered her ships so she could return to westeros where she belongs she refused them she refused them because hundreds of thousands of man woman and children still lived in chains as they have since the dawn of time not anymore you think you're a free man now you still follow orders just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she not a master friends friends friends please <i>open the gate</i> there have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing that is the way of the world i'm not here to change the way of the world slavery is the way of our world you don't need slaves to make money there haven't been slaves in westeros for hundreds of years and i grew up richer than any of you but our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery this is good soup without providing a new system to replace it so here is the queen proposal slavery will never return to meereen but she will give the other cities of slaver bay time to adjust to the new order what does that mean instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course at fair prices == sync

freedom instead of being drowned by it and as a parting gift to our honored guests give freedom a chance with the peas and onions mmm see if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before perhaps i should translate for you <i>we speak</i> <i>the common tongue </i> excellent you met with the slavers today <i>i did </i> our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum <i>now you invite them</i> <i>to our city and drink wine with them </i> i imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled but i am not your ruler we never should have left winterfell i'm not the breaker of chains i'm not the unburnt and i am certainly not the mother of dragons you are a stranger here so why do you represent meereen in these talks with our enemies because our queen chose me as her advisor until she returns from her travels when does she return soon you have my word we don't know you we don't trust you we know torgo nudho don't you wish we could go back to the day we left we fight with him against the masters we trust him and that is exactly why grey worm took part in these negotiations <i>as commander of the unsullied </i> <i>he knows how to defeat the slavers</i> and he knows when it is time to make peace you have made peace with the slavers <i>we offered terms </i> do not use me for your lies those man respect you they respect me because they know who i am they know i am loyal as do i i am loyal to my queen not you i want to scream at myself "don't go you idiot " if you betray her work you are my enemy i am not betraying her work i am trying to save her city you promised the slavers they could keep slavery for a short time seven years is not a short time for a slave you're right slavery is a horror that should be ended at once war is a horror that should be ended at once i can't do both today you are wrong to trust these man how could we know i don't trust the masters i trust their selfinterest they're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their selfinterest you don't know them you don't understand them we are not human in their eyes they look at me and see a weapon they look at her and see a whore they look at me and they see a misshapen little beast their contempt is their weakness they'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage i spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass i was to you you will not use them they will use you that is what they do you all right why don't you sit and catch your breath i'm fine i don't think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago maybe what our queen she wild you know don't let her size fool you it hard enough for me and i'm a young man <i>i wish i could</i> <i>change everything </i> you i don't think your heart could take it must make you angry that our queen chose me makes me sad you'll disappoint her before long she'll move on we'll all disappoint her before long we need each other right now after we're done needing each other oh i don't want to fight you jorah the andal what do i have to gain if i win i'm the shit who killed an old man if i lose i'm the shit who was killed by an old man you didn't get much discipline as a child did you we were children none the road running through the horse gate they call that the godsway eastern market western market when khal drogo died she was supposed to come here and join the dosh khaleen the widows of the dead khals that where they would have taken her <i>the temple</i> <i>of the dosh khaleen </i> what are you doing i was awful just admit it it forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi if they spot us and we're unarmed we'll say we're traders heading for the western market but if they see weapons you're asking a dog to hand over his teeth there 100 000 of them down there we can't fight our way out we wait till dark and then we'll find her uh where you gonna go you were occasionally awful i'm very attached to this knife don't worry it didn't touch you you know what happens i know what happens i'll do it myself i should have been born a dothraki come on told you i'm very attached to this knife you all right if they find a body with a stab wound i'm sure i can't have been great fun the whole city will be looking for us huh mmhmm no don't hurt her she'll give us away we have to go now we will never get out of vaes dothrak alive all we can do is try no we can do more than that and you're going to help me always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played if i were to let you leave right now where would you go <i> what would you seek out</i> i'd go to my brother my husband my family of course but for you that means seeking out money finery power seeking out your family means seeking out sin <i>i'm not maligning you </i> i sought those things out too to the exclusion of all else can you forgive me there nothing to forgive <i>my father was a cobbler </i> he died when i was young and i took over his shop he was a simple man and he made simple shoes but i found that the more work i put into my shoes the more people wanted them fine leather ornamantation detailing and time time most of all dozens of hours spent on a single pair quality takes time forgive me all right yes i imagine you've worn a year of someone life on your back <i>the highborn liked to cover</i> <i>their feet with my time</i> and they paid well for the privilege i used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself <i>each time i indulged </i> i felt myself ascending to something better and one day you walked through a graveyard all right i forgive you and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness book of the stranger verse 25 you know "the sevenpointed star " septa unella reads it to me at me yes yes she does enjoy reading at people you're close but it wasn't a graveyard it was a feast i bought old fine wine you'd think after thousands of years and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come and share it all <i>we passed around the wine </i> <i>passed around the woman </i> <i>and soon we fell</i> <i>into a stupor </i> i woke before dawn i could barely stand everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor lying in heaps next to their fine clothes the truth of their bodies laid bare i could smell them the night watch would have learned how to make a good ale beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn and i saw it with perfect clarity i saw what my sins were the gold i had the wine i drank the woman i used my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position it was all part of a story a story i was telling myself about who i was <i>a collection of lies</i> <i>that would disappear</i> <i>in the light </i> where will you go the people i was trying to climb away from the beggars in the street <i>the poor </i> they were closer to the truth than i ever was so what did you do <i>i left to go</i> <i>and find them </i> i didn't even put on my shoes i walked out the door and never went back come let go and see him who your brother where will <i>we</i> go loras loras listen to me you need to stay strong i can't stay strong i never was strong you are strong you are the future of our house the future of our family i don't care about that shh south if i don't watch over you shh have you have you told them that that you don't care i just want it to stop help me they want me to help you they want me to help tear you down they want me to help tear you down that why he letting me see you i know it is and if either of us give in to what they want then they win father ghost will come back and murder me let them win just make it stop please all right <i>and now how to avert disaster</i> <i>with our current predicamant </i> <i>this high sparrow </i> <i>i have dealt with fanatics</i> <i>of every description your grace </i> not setting them off that the most important thing you are beset with enemies both within and without what are you doing here where will we go i am advising the king on our current predicamant leave i am a member of the small council the king is this a small council meeting obviously not i'm here to lend my wisdom and my support thank you for your counsel grand maester that will be all for now your grace i can't stay here not after what happened since i've missed the past several small council meetings i wanted to speak to you about a few things i've been thinking about the high sparrow as have we all unfortunately we need to be careful in dealing with such a man to prevent things from escalating any further we have to be careful not to antagonize him he has margaery we can't put her at risk he dangerous look at me what did they do to me <i>there only one place</i> <i>we can go </i> to the king own mother it all right it done it in the past and of course margaery safety is paramount you don't like margaery do you whether i like her or not is completely unimportant margaery is the queen queens must command respect kings even more so not just for their own sake but for everyone home the high sparrow has no respect for kings or queens no respect for anything in this world he has no use for the things of this world he wants to knock them down and replace them with what with fantasies <i>with beggars</i> <i>in the street </i> with nothing mother there something i want to tell you something the high sparrow told me should we tell the boltons to pack up and leave you've spoken with him i promised him i wouldn't tell anyone if he found out i told it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth i am your mother you can always trust me the small council meeting has been postponed on the king orders i would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time <i>you're not welcome </i> <i>you once spoke of your</i> <i>respect for our father</i> we'll take it back from them because he understood the necessity of working with one rivals my dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority publically shamed and confined to the red keep what left to work with <i>cersei is the mother</i> <i>of the king </i> she has the king ear and his trust and the king has been speaking regularly with the high sparrow about queen margaery and ser loras the high sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves i don't have an army instead of seizing it back here we are well done to us now the future of the seven kingdoms rests in his dirty peasant hands in a few days he'll have a trial for me but before that queen margaery will make her walk of atonemant yes margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city oh no that cannot happen how many wildlings did you save that will not happen i agree you've got the second largest army in westeros you'll bring them into the city stop queen margaery humiliation before it starts and take her back into crown custody the king has ordered me to take no action against the high sparrow or the faith militant out of fear for the queen safety you will take no action at all when the tyrell armies come you will stand down what are you gonna do they didn't come here to serve me <i>are you expressly</i> <i>forbidden from standing down</i> no but if the king should call the whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything when the high sparrow is in custody or dead preferably and margaery back at tomman side do you think the king will be angry at the outcome you hate these fanatics as much as we do you hate what they've done to your son do you want lancel back or have you given him up for good they owe you their lives of course i want him back then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed if it doesn't go as planned the sparrows have many friends in this city we'll have civil war many will die many will die no matter what we do better them than us they told me you were home and i didn't believe it "theon greyjoy" i said you think they'll be safe here if roose bolton remains warden of the north "he dead he been dead a long time " he let you go i escaped i can't hear you i escaped look at me look at me man died trying to rescue you good man sansa winterfell is our home my man i'm sorry you were my brother you were a spoiled little cunt but you were my brother and i risked everything for you and you betrayed me i know i know and i'm sorry stop saying that he broke me he broke me into 1 000 pieces it ours and arya and bran and rickon i know you don't know he sent us one of those pieces that why i came for you why did you come here where else could i go you heard father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown no no i only heard he died after we docked you happen to show up on pyke right before the kingsmoot i didn't know you think any ironborn wants you to be king wherever they are it belongs to our family after what you've done i don't want to be king what do you want i should have listened to you you're the only one that doesn't matter anymore stop crying look at me tell me what you want you should rule the iron islands let me help you they've cleaned you up nicely we have to fight for it you know who i am a lord yes a lord you've seen my banners the flayed man does that worry you at all you eat them after no then i've seen worse i'm tired of fighting you served the starks aye they put me in chains and put a sword at my throat so i served them the starks have been gone for a long time but you kept protecting rickon he'd fetch a good price to the right buyer i served his family a long time didn't get no wages way i see it i'm owed it all i've done since i left home be that as it may rickon not yours to sell anymore he mine so what use could i possibly have for you i can give you what you want and you're sure you know what that is same thing man always want and when they really want it they give it a bath first you're a good talker i like that i've killed brothers of the night watch you're a much better talker than theon greyjoy that so i had to work hard to get him talking but he talked they all do he told me everything all about the stark boys who helped them escape and how she did it <i>open the gate</i> get warm i've killed wildlings i've killed man that i admire sorry about the food it not what we're known for that all right there are more important things a letter for you lord commander i'm not lord commander anymore "to the

years ago that would have been hard to do you weren't here last i heard you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time gallivanting that the sort of thing you start to say lady sansa

<i>getting ready to bring us</i> <i>back to glory </i> <i>and how will she do that</i> i will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen right idea except i'm the one who going to build the iron fleet <i>because i'm the one</i> <i>who knows how to use it </i> he beat you <i>i've been</i> <i>all over the world </i> i've seen more of it than all of you combined and across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of westeros just as much as we do someone with a large army three large dragons and no husband <i>i'm going to build</i> <i>that fleet</i> and i'm going to gallivant right over and give it to daenerys targaryen along with my big cock yes yes he enjoyed that you're going to seduce the dragon queen i'm not going to seduce her the iron fleet will seduce her and

you can find did he cut you quartersaw the timber and start building i want every man bending planks i want every woman spinning flax for sails build me a thousand ships and i will give you this world i banished you twice you came back twice and you saved my life so i can't take you back and i can't send you away maybe you did know about ramsay all along you must send me away is there a cure i don't know how long does it take i don't know that either but i've seen what happens when it goes far enough i'll end things before that i'm sorry i'm so sorry don't be i didn't know all i've ever wanted was to serve you tyrion lannister was right i love you i'll always love you goodbye khaleesi do not walk away from your queen jorah the andal you have not been dismissed you pledged yourself to me you swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life i thought you knew everyone secrets <i>well i command you</i> <i>to find the cure</i> <i>wherever it is</i> <i>in this world </i> i command you to heal yourself <i>and then return to me </i> when i take the seven kingdoms i need you by my side in the last fortnight since our pact with the masters how many killings have been carried out by the sons of the harpy none and how many masters have been butchered by the free man i made a mistake a horrible mistake two but that was the day of the pact <i>since then nothing </i> so it safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold for now for now is the best we get in our profession it not enough considering the city was on the brink of civil war i'd say it a good start it not enough for meereen to have peace they need to know daenerys is responsible for it i underestimated a stranger the sons of the harpy have a good story resist the foreign invaders our queen has an even better story mother of dragons breaker of chains and all that the people know who brought them freedom yes but do they know who brought them security who brought about an end to the violence we need someone the people trust someone they know cannot be bought or influenced sounds like quite the hero where would we find him the other things he did who said anything about "him" that about the extent of my valyrian thank you for travelling all this way i know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be the truth is we need your help we had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to you don't need to persuade me i came to help daenerys stormborn is the one who was promised from the fire she was reborn to remake the world for you my lady ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things yes she has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the masters for their sins she did indeed her dragons are fire made flesh a gift from the lord of light but you heard all of this before haven't you on the long bridge of volantis <i>the dragons will</i> <i>purify nonbelievers by the thousands </i> burning their sins and flesh away but i imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers the mother of dragons has followers of many different faiths you want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed and while she gone you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed i'd settle for obeyed <i>i will summon</i> <i>my most eloquent priests </i> they will spread the word daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come i can still feel it that sounds most excellent a man named stannis baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses he too had a glorious destiny he attacked king landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me last i had heard he had been defeated again this time at winterfell and this time for good we'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen i suppose it hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake i don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic you're always right everything is the lord will everything is the lord will but man and woman make mistakes even honest servants of the lord and you an honest servant of the lord why should i trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled stannis my friend has a healthy skepticism of religion i can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now but we are all loyal supporters of the queen everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason terrible things happen for a reason take what happened to you lord varys when you were a child <i>if not for your mutilation</i> <i>at the hand of</i> <i>a secondrate sorcerer </i> <i>you wouldn't be here</i> <i>helping the lord chosen</i> <i>bring his light</i> <i>into the world </i> knowledge has made you powerful i'm so sorry but there still so much you don't know <i>do you remember</i> <i>what you heard that night</i> <i>when the sorcerer tossed</i> <i>your parts in the fire</i> you heard a voice call out from the flames do you remember should i tell you what the voice said should i tell you the name of the one who spoke we serve the same queen if you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me you said you would protect me what he saw me the night king <i>he saw me</i> he touched you i don't know he was close but he touched you he knows you are here he'll come for you but he can't get in he can now his mark is on you you must leave all of you <i>come on hodor </i> <i>help me with the sledge </i> and i will hodor i'm sorry i didn't mean to the time has come the time for what for you to become me but am i ready no we can't defend the north from the walkers and the south from the boltons if we want to survive we need winterfell and to take winterfell we need more man you must believe me when i tell you that i will <i>aside from the starks</i> <i>and the boltons </i> the most powerful houses in the north are the umbers the karstarks and the manderlys the umbers and the karstarks have already declared for the boltons so we're not doing so well there the umbers gave rickon to our enemies they can hang but the karstarks declared for ramsay without knowing they had another choice i don't believe you anymore i don't need you anymore i beg your pardon my lady but they know that a stark beheaded their father i don't think we can count on them either how well do you know the north ser davos precious little my lady <i>my father always said</i> <i>northerners are different </i> more loyal more suspicious of outsiders they may well be loyal but how many rose up against the boltons when they betrayed your family how far is mole town you can't protect me i may not know the north but i know man they're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause if jon going to convince them to fight alongside him they need to believe it a fight they can win there are more than three other houses in the north glover mormont cerwyn <i>mazin hornwood </i> two dozen more together they equal all the others you won't even be able to protect yourself we can start small and build <i>the north remembers </i> <i>they remember</i> <i>the stark name </i> people will still risk everything for it from white harbor to ramsay own door i don't doubt it but jon doesn't have the stark name no but i do jon is every bit as much ned stark son as ramsay is roose bolton if i tell brienne to cut you down <i>and there are also the tullys </i> <i>they're not northern </i> <i>but they will back us against</i> <i>the boltons without question </i> i didn't know the tullys still had an army my uncle the blackfish has reformed it and retaken riverrun how do you know that ramsay received a raven before i escaped winterfell that good the blackfish is a legend his support would mean a great deal and why shouldn't i stark tully a few more houses almost starts to look like a winning side i've sworn to protect you my lady you heard them we need more man and my uncle has an army we can send the blackfish a raven can't risk ramsay intercepting it it has to be you ride for riverrun my uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him do you want me to beg for my life what is it i don't like leaving you here alone with jon not him he seems trustworthy a bit brooding perhaps i suppose that understandable considering the others though davos and the red woman helped a man murder his own brother with bloodmagic <i>and when stannis paid for his crime </i> <i>where were they</i> if that what you want i will already out looking for a leader with better prospects and that wildling fellow with the beard jon isn't tormund jon isn't davos the red woman or stannis for that matter jon is jon he my brother he'll keep me safe i trust him then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about riverrun new dress i made it myself do you like it yeah it i like the wolf bit good because i made this for you whatever you ask that is in my power <i>i made it like the one</i> <i>father used to wear </i> as near as i can remember thank you sansa

walking naked in the streets or will i spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy you have served your house and your king faithfully for many years and you will continue to do so he hoped i'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings " but not in this city you've lost it yes father it a castle not a bloody sheep presumably you still know where it is you didn't lose riverrun you let the blackfish take it from you he surprised us he knows the castle better than anyone you did lose the blackfish after the red wedding you had him right here in this hall and you let him leave so it probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible then when i told you to hunt him down and kill him you couldn't find him that what it means to lose something now he come back and taken riverrun i don't think it fair to blame us for 300 years we kissed tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners not again riverrun is ours take it back we don't have the man i think we're here we've got 10 times as many man as the damn blackfish <i>the mallisters have risen</i> <i>against us and the blackwoods </i> <i>the brotherhood without banners</i> <i>is rallying the commoners against us </i> <i>raiding our supply trains</i> <i>and camps </i> <i>riverrun can withstand</i> <i>a siege for a year </i> if i want excuses i'll put her in charge

we were never there at all we'll be the last of the free folk that what'll happen to you if we lose the boltons the karstarks the umbers when i found you i thought you'd been dead for days they know you're here they know that more than half of you are woman and children after they finish with me they'll come for you you're right this isn't your fight you shouldn't have to come to winterfell with me i shouldn't be asking you it not the deal we made i need you with me if we're going to beat them and we need to beat them if you're going to survive the way you were stinking already the crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would he died for us if we are not willing to do the same for him we're cowards and if that what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk snow are you sure they'll come we're not clever like you southerners when we say we'll do something we do it and you had bugs all over you i heard you were leaving king landing that is hardly your concern your grandson is still a prisoner you'll leave him rotting in a cell loras rots in a cell because of you the high sparrow rules this city because of you our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity you're right i made a terrible mistake and bone was coming through right there i carry it with me every single day good i delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep and now we must fight them together we need each other i wonder if you're the worst person i've ever met at a certain age it hard to recall but the truly vile do stand out through the years do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells steady steady i was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed i do i'll never forget it you love your granddaughter i love my son it the only truth i know we must defend them i'm leaving this wretched city as fast as i can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells if you're half as bright as you think you are you'll find a way out of here too never oh nearly shit myself i'll never leave my son what'll you do then you have no support not anymore your brother gone the high sparrow saw to that the rest of your family have abandoned you the people despise you you're surrounded by enemies thousands of them you're going to kill them all by yourself you've lost cersei it the only joy i can find in all this misery i reckoned you were gonna die pick the pace up keep going keep it moving now that is a sorry attempt at a siege someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches someone certainly does oh no not me i'm just an upjumped sellsword you're an anointed knight there quite a difference aye knights don't get paid by the time i loaded you on the wagon but you didn't you have better instincts than any officer in the lannister army that like saying i have a bigger cock than anyone in the unsullied army i expect to command all the lannister forces before long you can be the right hand i lost you promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife and you'll get all three a lannister always don't say it don't fucking say it come out and fight us blackfish we have lord edmure now i reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days yield the castle or we'll hang him this is your last warning yield the castle you think i won't do it old man i sliced your niece throat from ear to ear and where were you running and hiding like a fucking coward yield the castle or i cut his throat go on then cut his throat lothar is it ser jaime but you didn't what kept you going we didn't know you were coming 'cause you didn't set a proper perimeter you just allowed 8 000 man to approach unchallenged good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now have lord edmure bathed and fed walder edmure is a prisoner of house frey only a fool makes threats he not prepared to carry out now let say i threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth but you kept talking hate what do you think i'd do i don't give a rat i'm here by the king command to take back this castle have him bathed and fed unless you'd like to take his place apologies ser jaime do as he says the siege is now under my command the next time the blackfish looks out from those ramparts he'll see an army at his gates not whatever this is have your lads start digging perimeter trenches no there a reason you're still here set pickets every hundred yards and work doubletime on those siege towers and trebuchets those are our siege towers as i said the siege is under my command if that not to your liking go home get word to the blackfish i want a parley a parley or a fight he an old man you've got one hand aye there a reason i'm a big fucker and i'm tough to kill my money on the old boy lady mormont welcome to bear island i remember when you were born my lady you were named for my aunt lyanna it was said she was a great beauty i'm sure you will be too i doubt it my mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty she was a great warrior though she died fighting for your brother robb no a reason i served under your uncle at castle black lady lyanna he was also a great warrior and an honorable man i was his steward in fact i think we've had enough small talk why are you here stannis baratheon garrisoned at castle black before he marched on winterfell and was killed he showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for man it said i remember what it said bear island knows no king but the king in the north whose name is stark up she goes gods aren't done with you yet robb is gone but house stark is not and it needs your support now more than ever i've come with my sister to ask for house mormont allegiance as far as i understand you're a snow and lady sansa is a bolton or is she a lannister i've heard conflicting reports i did what i had to do to survive my lady but i am a stark i will always be a stark i've heard that before if you say so in any case you don't just want my allegiance you want my fighting man ramsay bolton cannot be allowed to keep winterfell my lady it is our duty to stop him even more so because he holds our brother rickon stark as prisoner what you have to understand my lady is that i understand that i'm responsible for bear island and all who live here so why should i sacrifice one more mormont life for someone else war if it please my lady i understand how you feel man was talking about a different god though i don't know you ser davos my lady of house seaworth you needn't ask your maester about my house it rather new all right ser davos of house seaworth how is it you understand how i feel you never thought you'd find yourself in your position being responsible for so many lives at such a young age i never thought i'd be in my position i was a crabber son then i was a smuggler well maybe he was right and now i find myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war but i'm here because this isn't someone else war it our war go on ser davos your uncle lord commander mormont made that man his steward he chose jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right even if it meant giving his life i don't know much about the gods because jeor mormont and jon snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses it between the living and the dead and make no mistake my lady the dead are coming is this true your uncle fought them at the fist of the first man i fought them at hardhome we both lost as long as the boltons hold winterfell the north is divided you're in the wrong line of work and a divided north won't stand a chance against the night king you want to protect your people my lady i understand but there no hiding from this we have to fight and we need to do it together house mormont has kept faith with house stark for 1 000 years we will not break faith today thank you my lady how many fighting man can we expect 62 62 we are not a large house oh there plenty of pious sons of bitches but we're a proud one and every man from bear island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders if they're half as ferocious as their lady the boltons are doomed kingslayer blackfish i assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece i don't see sansa and arya who think they know the word of god or gods i don't have them pity do you wish to resume your captivity then why are you here you know why i'm here this castle belongs to house frey you're trespassing in the name of king tomman i order you to surrender or or you'll kill edmure my nephew marked for death no matter what hang him and be done with it i don't i don't even know their real names it won't stop with edmure you'll force me to storm the castle hundreds will die hundreds of mine thousands of yours if you can breach the walls we'll breach them and kill every last one of you but if you surrender i'll spare the lives of your man on my honor your honor maybe it is the seven or maybe it the old gods bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand the war is over ser why sacrifice living man to a lost cause as long as i'm standing the war is not over this is my home i was born in this castle and i'm ready to die in it so you can either attack or try to starve us out we have enough provisions for two years do you have two years kingslayer hey come on put your back into it huh or maybe it the lord of light you clearly have no intention of saving your man lives why did you come treat with me sieges are dull and i wanted to see you in person get the measure of you well now you have aye now i have i'm disappointed the answer is no lord glover if you could just hear us out i've heard enough we've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn or maybe they're all the same fucking thing the boltons helped us do it now you want me to fight against them i could be skinned for even talking to you the boltons are traitors roose bolton have other northern houses pledged to fight for you house mormont and we sent ravens to houses manderly i don't care about ravens you're asking me to join your army i don't know who is fighting in this army the bulk of the force is made up of wildlings then the rumors are true i didn't dare believe them i received you out of respect for your father now i would like you to leave house glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings lord glover there nothing else to say i would remind you that house glover what matters i believe is pledged to house stark sworn to answer when called upon yes my family served house stark for centuries we wept when we heard of your father death when my brother was lord of this castle he answered robb call and hailed him king in the north and where was king robb when the ironborn attacked this castle when they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects is that there something greater than us taking up with a foreign whore getting himself and those who followed him killed i served house stark once but house stark is dead why did we have to come here some of us still like it have a drink at least i don't want one don't go far love i'll find you in a bit and whatever it is it got plans for sandor clegane nothing on the iron islands has an ass like that doesn't interest you anymore i'm sorry i won't joke about it i'll never hurt you little brother don't you know that you think uncle euron hunting for us of course he is as long as we're alive we're a threat he'll find us it a great big world and we have fast ships drink you didn't know me back in my time i don't want any i don't care what you want drink drink it all you're ironborn theon i know you've had some bad years some bad years but i'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog drink the goddamn ale now listen to me i need you the real theon greyjoy not this rat shit pretender you don't know the things i've done can you find him for me drink you escaped you hear me you got away and you're never going back we'll get justice for you if i got justice my burnt body would hang over the gates of winterfell fuck justice then we'll get revenge drink listen to me if you're so broken that there no coming back take a knife and cut your wrists i've heard stories end it but if you're staying theon i need you we're gonna sail to meereen we're gonna make a pact with this dragon queen and we're gonna take back the iron islands are you with me are you really with me now since it my last night ashore for a long while i'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one stannis camped here on his way to winterfell if the gods are real and that a good thing he was the most experienced commander in westeros he chose this place for a reason those mountains are a natural fortification there a stream down there for the horses we're not staying here long another storm could hit any day aye the snows defeated stannis as much as the boltons did we have to march on winterfell now while we still can here you are son why haven't they punished me 2 000 wildlings 200 hornwoods 143 mazins 62 mormonts it not what we'd hoped for but we still have a chance if we're careful and smart for fuck sake so he your most trusted advisor now because he secured 62 man from a 10yearold ser davos is the reason i'm standing here talking to you and he served stannis for years they have stannis who lost the blackwater who murdered his own brother who doesn't have a head it not enough we need more man there no time if we went down to castle cerwyn i know that lord we fight with the army we have friends this is not worth fighting over this'll be it now right now we don't need to be fighting who the fuck are you hold on your grace yeah who the fuck are you i was a soldier once all my superiors thought i was brave i wasn't i mean i never ran from a fight only because i was afraid my friends would see i was afraid that all i was a coward we followed orders no matter the orders burn that village fine i'm your arsonist steal that farmer crops good i'm your thief what are we reading today kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us i'm your murderer i remember once a woman screaming at us calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut but we weren't animals animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours i cut that young boy throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back the book of the mother your holiness that night i felt such shame shame was so heavy on me i couldn't eat i couldn't sleep all i could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son name i'll hear her screaming the rest of my life now i know i can never bring that lad back all i can do with time i've got left is bring a little goodness into the world chapter three verse 12 that all any of us can do isn't it never too late to stop robbing people to stop killing people start helping people it never too late to come back and it not about waiting for the gods

she plan on taking winterfell the tully army they're a bit occupied at the momant i was sent here to reclaim riverrun currently defended by the tully rebels so you can see the conundrum the tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home a moon or my life riverrun was granted to the freys by royal decree as a reward for betraying robb stark and slaughtering his family exactly we shouldn't argue about politics you're a knight ser jaime i know there is honor in you i've seen it myself i'm a lannister don't ask me to betray my own house i do no such thing take riverrun without bloodshed <i>what is that</i> <i>i hear and smell</i> ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact what do you propose allow me to enter riverrun under a flag of truce let me try to persuade the blackfish to give up the castle why would he abandon his ancestral home because you'll allow him to lead the tully forces safely north have you ever met the blackfish no he even more stubborn than you are all right <i> someone i'll soon send to hell </i> try to talk some sense into the old goat he won't listen but his man might not everybody wants to die for someone else home i need your word

onehanded friend thinks we can he not my friend no who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel ser jaime kept his word to your niece catelyn stark he sent me to find sansa to help her as catelyn wanted <i>you beast you beast </i> <i>you killed my wife </i> he gave me this sword to protect her that is what i have done and i will continue to do until the day i die she exactly like her mother i don't have enough man to help her take winterfell you have more than she does she wants her home back i understand that but this is my home and if jaime lannister wants it he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does <i> and now you've taken</i> <i>your father life </i> find the maester we need to get a raven north to sansa what should i write tell her i failed there to be a royal announcemant there is why wasn't i informed there is to be a royal announcemant in the throne room at this very momant <i>my son </i> <i>no worse child</i> <i>ever stained this land </i> where are you going to stand by my son your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court <i>your grace </i> <i>lords and ladies </i> the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other the father judges us all <i>i curse the day i named you </i> if you break his laws <i>you will be punished </i> after conferring with his holiness the high septon we have determined that loras tyrell and cersei lannister trial <i>will be held in</i> <i>the great sept of baelor</i> <i>on the first day</i> <i>of the festival of the mother </i> furthermore after much prayer <i>and reflection </i> the crown has decided that from this day forward <i>my greatest crime</i> trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the seven kingdoms <i>the tradition</i> <i>is a brutish one </i> <i>a scheme devised</i> <i>by corrupt rulers</i> <i>in order to avoid</i> <i>true judgmant from the gods </i> <i>cersei lannister</i> <i>and loras tyrell</i> will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the faith <i>seven blessings to all </i> <i>seven blessings </i> you're good at that your grace that old rumor you told me about my little birds investigated and was it just a rumor or something more more much more <i>you seem happy </i> i am happy you should both be happy as well where did you learn not so long ago this city was ready to devour itself now it like a man reborn i will be happy when our queen returns why don't you drink why don't either of you ever drink unsullied never drink why not rules and who made these rules your former masters <i>those miserable old shits</i> <i>didn't want you to be human </i> have a drink with me i'm a jealous woman and you what your excuse i have tried wine before it made me feel funny that how you know it working here to our queen anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen to daenerys stormborn mother of dragons breaker of chains long may she reign long may she reign long may she reign <i>do you like it</i> i've always liked bad man tastes like it has turned yes yes fermantation one day after our queen has taken the seven kingdoms i'd like to have my own vineyard make my own wine the imp delight only my close friends could drink it tell me a joke missandei of naath i do not know any jokes grey worm and they've always liked me right three lords walk into a tavern a stark a martell and a lannister <i>they order ale </i> but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup the lannister outraged shoves the cup aside and demands another the martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole the stark reaches into his cup pulls out the fly and shouts they'd come home wherever home was that night "spit it out you wee shit spit it out " it funnier in westeros the starks and the lannisters i thought these were enemies yes a joke is like a story torgo nudho not a true story necessarily a story that supposed to make you laugh ideally <i>not at the momant </i> <i>perhaps </i> <i>missandei </i> <i>do you like the wine</i> stinking of some whore perfume i do tell a joke two translators are on a sinking ship the first says "do you know how to swim" the second says "no but i can shout for help in 19 languages " ah that is the worst joke i ever heard you don't even know what a joke is i am soldier all my life you think i never hear joke my firstborn son so we'd fight and i'd put a hole in them you lied to us i make joke more jokes i once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass the madam says the masters have come for their property lord edmure <i>i apologize for the way</i> <i>the freys treated you </i> a man of your birth deserves better and then i'd feel terrible you have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on i have your word oh good good that that a fine thing my uncle will never surrender the castle ser whatever game you're playing the blackfish is an old man a good death is all he can hope for but you you have a child now i've heard so i'd patch them up a son you sired on your wedding night you're a potent man a son i've never met born of a wife that i haven't seen since our first night together you should be with them both i can arrange that you realize comfortable rooms for you at casterly rock a tutor for your boy knights to train him to fight and to ride and when he comes of age he'll have a keep of his own <i>i got good</i> <i>at patching them up </i> do you imagine yourself a decent person is that it after you've massacred my family kept me in a cell for years stolen our lands i'll remind you that our houses are at war i'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but rebelling against the crown does have consequences says the man who shoved his sword through his king back did i give you the impression that this was a negotiation and good at putting holes in them it not you understand on some level you understand that you're an evil man i'll leave the judgmants to the gods well that is convenient for you you're a finelooking fellow aren't you your square jaw your golden armor tell me i want to know i truly do and that how do you live with yourself all of us have to believe that we're decent don't we you have to sleep at night how do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done i was your sister prisoner once she hit me on the head with a rock if i remember correctly yeah what happened to the actress she should have killed you perhaps but she didn't catelyn stark hated me just like you hate me <i>but i didn't hate her </i> i admired her far more than her husband or her son do you think i care whom you admire and whom you don't no i don't but i'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner you don't have a choice the love she had for her children <i>the one who wanted</i> <i>you dead </i> i was a little awed by it reminded me of my sister oh oh i see you're a madman i'm not here to trade insults your sister was a strong don't talk about cat i'll talk about whomever i want she loved her children i suppose all mothers do but catelyn and cersei bianca there a fierceness you don't often see they'd do anything to protect their babies start a war burn cities to ash free their worst enemies the things we do for love you didn't come here to talk about our sisters that exactly why i came here i love cersei you can laugh at that if you want you can sneer doesn't matter she'll have a hard time finding work as an actress she needs me and to get back to her i have to take riverrun i'll send for your baby boy and i'll launch him into riverrun with a catapult because you don't matter to me lord edmure your son doesn't matter to me the people in the castle don't matter to me only cersei and if i have to slaughter every tully who ever lived to get back to her my child king hush after what i did to her face that what i'll do <i>who goes there</i> edmure tully son of hoster tully and the rightful lord of riverrun i demand entry don't let him in he the lord of riverrun i have to obey his commands he been their captive mmm ever since they murdered his king at the red wedding why do you think the people who murdered his king at the red wedding would decide to let him come home because it a trap you idiot don't let him in he my lord my lord i've sworn to serve the lord of riverrun and obey his commands you're not obeying edmure commands you're obeying the fucking kingslayer commands <i>i demand entry </i> i never did

years i expect i'll make a damn fool of myself we found the blackfish my lord you should come with us good bring him to me he died fighting my lord i was wrong i admit it that changes nothing the unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead if the slavers' forces no more talking from you your talking gave us this and i have acknowledged that i'm trying you're trying to tell me what the army should do <i>you do not know</i> <i>what the army should do </i> i can't why not all right what should the army do we'll not go to the beach if we go to the beach the masters will take the pyramid the pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend we stay here and then we wait for them to come to us then we fight them clegane what the fuck you doing here chasing them you got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work hanging them any particular reason they're our man or they were they attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers <i>why do you want them</i> same reason i was helping build it <i>they killed</i> <i>a friend of mine </i> you've got friends not anymore they're mine and besides we need a new actress it the brotherhood good name they've dragged through the dirt fuck your name they're mine i killed you once before dondarrion happy to do it again drop that arrow you bloody girl tougher girls than you have tried to kill me you can have one of

cold winds are rising in the north and you're going to go stop them you wouldn't be safe we need good man to help us last time you saw me you wanted to execute me <i>true enough </i> but the lord of light gave you the power to defeat me why i beat you because i'm better than you beric i was better than you before you started yammering on about the lord and i'm better than you now aye you're probably right you're a fighter not while she looking for me you were born a fighter you walked away from the fight how did that go good and bad young and old the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike <i>you can still help a lot more</i> <i>than you've harmed clegane </i> it not too late for you lady crane <i>lady crane</i> if you'd have done your job she would have died painlessly

the one with the yellow cloak fuck you those are your last words fuck you come on you can do better 0 game of thrones s06e09 battle of the bastards srt despite appearances i think you'll find the city on the rise the masters cannot let meereen succeed get off your horse and kneel i'm a man of mercy you're right there no need for a battle thousands of man don't need to die only one of us let end this the old way you against me i keep hearing stories about you bastard the way people in the north talk about you because if meereen succeeds a city without slavery you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked maybe you are that good maybe not i don't know if i'd beat you but i know that my army will beat yours i have 6 000 man you have what half that not even aye you have the numbers will your man want to fight for you a city without masters when they hear you wouldn't fight for them he good very good tell me will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender how do we know you have him now if you want to save you're going to die tomorrow lord bolton sleep well she a fine woman your sister i look forward to having her back in my bed it proves that no one needs a master and you're all finelooking man my dogs are desperate to meet you i haven't fed them for seven days they're ravenous i wonder which parts they'll try first your eyes your balls we'll find out soon enough in the morning then bastard if he was smart he'd stay inside the walls of winterfell and wait us out good that not his way he knows the north is watching if the other houses sense weakness on his part they'll stop fearing him he can't have that fear is his power it his weakness too his man don't want to fight for him they're forced to fight for him if they feel the tide turning it not his man that worry me it his horses i know what mounted knights can do to us you and stannis cut through us like piss through snow shall we begin we're digging trenches all along our flanks they won't be able to hit us the way that stannis hit you in a double envelopmant a pincer move they won't be able to hit us from the sides good it crucial that we let them charge at us they've got the numbers we need the patience if we let him buckle our center he'll pursue then we'll have him surrounded on three sides do we have a plan did you really think that cunt would fight you mantoman no but i wanted to make him angry i want him coming at us full tilt we should all get some sleep rest jon snow we need you sharp tomorrow so you've met the enemy drawn up your battle plans aye for what they're worth you've known him for the space of a single conversation i will crucify the masters you and your trusted advisors and you sit around making your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know i lived with him i know the way his mind works i know how he likes to hurt people did it ever once occur to you that i might have some insight you're right you think he going to fall into your trap he won't he the one who lays traps i will set their fleets afire he overconfident he plays with people he far better at it than you he been doing it all his life aye and what have i been doing all my life playing with broomsticks i fought beyond the wall against worse than ramsay bolton i've defended the wall from worse than ramsay bolton you don't know him all right tell me what should we do how do we get rickon back we'll never get him back rickon is ned stark trueborn son kill every last one of their soldiers which makes him a greater threat to ramsay than you a bastard or me a girl as long as he lives ramsay claim to winterfell will be contested which means he won't live long we can't give up on our brother listen to me please he wants you to make a mistake of course he does what should i do differently i don't know i don't know anything about battles just don't do what he wants you to do aye that good advice perhaps we should take shelter and return their cities to the dirt you think that obvious well it is a bit obvious if you had asked for my advice earlier i would have told you not to attack winterfell until we had a larger force or is that obvious too when will we have a larger force we've pleaded with every house that'll have us the blackfish can't help us we're lucky to have this many man it not enough no it not enough it what we have that is my plan battles have been won against greater odds if ramsay wins i'm not going back there alive do you understand me i won't let ever let him touch you again i'll protect you i promise no one can protect me no one can protect anyone you think there hope i've never seen these bolton fuckers fight you don't approve and they've never seen the free folk fight so yes there hope you want to avenge your king don't you it wasn't the boltons defeated stannis it was stannis himself i loved the man he lifted me up and made me something but he had demons in his skull whispering foul things you saw these demons what no it a manner of speaking you once told me you knew what your father was not actual demons well you loved that cunt stannis and i loved the man he burned mance didn't have demons in his skull he didn't torch people or listen to some red witch i believed in him i thought he was the man to lead us through the long night but i was wrong just like you maybe that was our mistake believing in kings jon snow not a king did you know his plans for king landing no he not i need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight you want some i have a jug of sour goat milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on no thanks it does sound delicious but i better keep a clear head i can never sleep the night before a battle so what do you do all night when the lannister armies were at his gates i walk think and walk think and walk until i'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out happy shitting my lady you weren't at the war council i'm not a soldier any advice don't lose probably not if i do if i fall don't bring me back i'll have to try i'm ordering you not to bring me back i am not your servant jon snow you're in my camp i'm the commander i serve the lord of light i do what he commands how do you know what he commands i interpret his signs well he told my brother and jaime told me as well as i can if the lord didn't want me to bring you back how did i bring you back i have no power only what he gives me and he gave me you why i don't know maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else maybe he brought you here to die again what kind of god would do something like that he had caches of wildfire hidden under the red keep the one we've got last time we saw each other was at winterfell yes you were making jokes about my height i seem to recall everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf height thinks he the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf height "the height of nobility " "a man of your stature " "someone to look up to " you're all making the same five or six jokes it was a long time ago it was and how have things been going for you since then the guildhalls the sept of baelor not so well i gather can't imagine you would have murdered the stark boys if things had been going well i didn't murder the stark boys but i did things that were just as bad or worse and he paid for them doesn't seem like it he still alive it was complicated for you i'm sure growing up at winterfell never quite knowing who you were the city on the rise all the major thoroughfares but then we all live complicated lives don't we you've brought us 100 ships from the iron fleet with man to sail them in return i expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the iron islands not my claim hers and what wrong with you i'm not fit to rule we can agree upon that at least has the iron islands ever had a queen before he would have burned every one of his citizens no more than westeros our uncle euron returned home after a long absence he murdered our father and took the salt throne from yara he would have murdered us if we'd stayed lord tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king you and i have that in common we do and both murdered by a usurper as well will their ships be enough with the former masters' fleet possibly the loyal ones and the traitors barely there are more than 100 ships in the iron fleet there are and euron is building more he going to offer them to you so why shouldn't i wait for him the iron fleet isn't all he bringing he also wants to give you his big cock i think he said euron offer is also an offer of marriage you see you won't get one without the other every man woman and child and i imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands i never demand but i'm up for anything really he murdered our father and would have murdered us he'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants the seven kingdoms all of them and you don't want the seven kingdoms your ancestors defeated ours and took the iron islands we ask you to give them back and that all that why jaime killed him we'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman fit to rule reasonable what if everyone starts demanding their independence she not demanding she asking the others are free to ask as well our fathers were evil man all of us here they left the world worse than they found it we're not going to do that we're going to leave the world better than we found it this is entirely different you will support my claim as queen of the seven kingdoms and respect the integrity of the seven kingdoms no more reaving roving raiding or raping that our way of life no more no more do you like games little man let play a game run to your brother the sooner you make it to him you're talking about destroying cities the sooner you get to see him again that it that the game easy ready go no you have to run remember those are the rules `t`u`s`u`b`t`i`t`u`l`o`c`o`m don't it not entirely different prepare to charge prepare to charge draw draw draw loose go go follow your commander run and fight nock draw draw loose loose i'd like to

advance with me lads break their line help me tormund get him back infantry advance both sides fall back fall back fuck this come on we're going home you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships open the gate archers to the wall their army gone our army gone we have winterfell they don't have the man for a siege all we have to do is wait archers to the wall you suggested oneonone combat didn't you i've reconsidered i think that sounds like a wonderful idea instead you will flee slaver bay on foot we're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father jon where is he sansa hello sansa is this where i'll be staying now no our time together is about to come to an end that all right like the beggar queen you are you can't kill me i'm part of you now your words will disappear your house will disappear your name will disappear all memory of you will disappear my hounds will never harm me you haven't fed them in seven days you said it yourself they're loyal beasts we are here to discuss terms of surrender they were now they're starving sit down down down down down not to trade insults the terms are simple you and your foreign friends will abandon the great pyramid and the city of meereen the unsullied you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder commerce has returned to the markets the translator you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder the dragons beneath the great pyramid will be slaughtered we obviously didn't communicate clearly we're here to discuss your surrender not mine i imagine it difficult adjusting to the new reality your reign is over my reign has just begun dracarys the people are behind you your man have a choice: fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you or go home to your families thank you for the armada our queen does love ships now last time we spoke we made a pact you violated that pact you declared war upon us though our queen does have a forgiving nature this cannot be forgiven well not all the people of course our queen insists that one of you must die as punishmant for your crimes it always seems a bit abstract doesn't it other people dying him he should die yes him he not one of us he an outsider a lowborn he does not speak for us please please no ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people tell your people what happened here tell them you live by the grace of her majesty when they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory remind them what happened when daenerys stormborn and her dragons came to meereen you don't have to be here yes i do my beloved wife i've missed you terribly but the rebirth of meereen is the cause of this violence thank you for returning lady bolton safely now dismount and kneel before me surrender your army and proclaim me the true lord of winterfell and warden of the north i will pardon you for deserting the night watch i will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house come bastard you don't have the man you don't have the horses and you don't have winterfell why lead those poor souls into slaughter there no need for a battle 0 game of thrones s06e10 the winds of winter srt your grace i confess before the seven confess no confess confess it felt good beating me starving me frightening me humiliating me you didn't do it because you cared about my atonemant you did it because it felt good i understand i do things because they feel good i drink because it feels good and freely admit to my crimes i killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him i fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me i lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites i killed your high sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons all his septas all his filthy soldiers because it felt good to watch them burn it felt good to imagine their shock and their pain to which crimes will you be confessing no thought has ever given me greater joy even confessing feels good under the right circumstances you've always been quiet i said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died do you remember good i'm glad to see your face i'm ready to meet the gods what now all of them today you're not going to die today you're not going to die for quite a while ser gregor this is ser gregor clegane he quiet too your gods have forsaken you this is your god now no no i lay with other man shame shame shame i'm very sorry your grace very sorry for house lannister hear me roar for house frey we stand together may we stand together through the centuries including the traitor renly baratheon good friends to the last and when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts may we speak the words of our alliance "the freys and the lannisters send their regards " you don't even have to do anything do you you just sit there a rich slab of beef and all the birds come pecking you're welcome to her she doesn't want me she wants your golden fingers up her twat i perjured myself before the gods those two have their eyes on you they have their eyes on you cunt not my type not blonde enough ladies have you met ser bronn of the blackwater hero of the battle of blackwater bay there you go maybe i'm not in the mood fuck it no need to call me ser just because i'm an anointed knight this came together rather well i am guilty of depravity your father would be pleased i'm sure he would be edmure is back in a cell can't go killing my son by law it wouldn't be right give the family a bad name so the famous blackfish killed by foot soldiers eh legendary warrior everyone said have you done much fighting yourself lord frey i'm a bit old for all that no but back in your day dishonesty the purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies isn't it i've defeated mine riverrun belonged to house tully for a thousand years now it mine what do you call that victory yes you're a great conqueror go on mock me boy you think i mind the tullys mocked me for years profligacy the starks mocked me where are they now you talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle i remember you fighting you were captured by robb stark the young wolf but it doesn't matter here we are now two kingslayers we know what it like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs we don't mind do we the trial will be getting under way soon and arrogance fear is a marvelous thing they don't fear the freys though they fear the lannisters we gave you the riverlands to hold the riverlands if we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you show me your grace there no need show me i see that now what are your thoughts concerning the king funeral as the sept of baelor is no longer an option perhaps a ceremony in the throne room he should be with his grandfather his brother his sister burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood hello from lord commander snow at castle black i'm i humble myself before the seven i'm to be the new maester according to our records jeor mormont is lord commander he died we received no report from the maester at castle black maester aemon became quite ill shortly after the election he since passed away jon snow will go to "t|u|s|u|b|t|i|t|u|l|o|" which is why i'm here this is irregular and accept whatever punishmant the gods deem just yes well i suppose that life is irregular the archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you in the meantime you are permitted to use the library follow me no woman or children when we had feasts our family would sit up here and i'd sit down there could have been worse jon snow the gods' judgmant is fierce you had a family you had feasts aye you're right i was luckier than most what is that tell him tell him who it belonged to the princess shireen tell him what you did to her tell him we burned her at the stake but also fair why the army was trapped the horses were dying it was the only way you burned a little girl alive i only do what my lord commands if he commands you to burn children your lord is evil we are standing here because of him jon snow is alive because the lord willed it i loved that girl like she was my own she was good she was kind and you killed her so did her father the warrior punishes those who believe themselves so did her mother her own blood knew it was the only way the only way for what they all

coast if we take casterly rock the lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit king landing you're not going to westeros you're staying here with the second sons for others to witness there finally peace in meereen you will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders fuck meereen fuck the people i'm here for you not them you promised me "my sword is yours my life is yours " this is what i command if i'm going to rule in westeros i'll need to make alliances you understand fully the best way to make alliances is with marriage who are you marrying this time i don't know maybe no one but you need to lure all the noble houses to the table are you a queen or fish bait i can't bring a lover to westeros a king wouldn't think twice about it so that what you want to be my mistress i'm not proud i don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room what this means i don't want a crown i want you i love you and i make you happy you know i do bring me with you let me fight for you i can't the dwarf told you to do this no one tells me to do anything clever fellow can't argue with his logic i'm no use to you over there i do don't get angry i'm not

of meereen and the bay of dragons bay of dragons we can't call it slaver bay anymore can we you'll get that throne you want so badly i'm sure of it i will abandon the tyrell name i hope it brings you happiness i pity the lords of westeros they have no idea what coming for them farewell daario naharis how did he take it no tears i know it was hard for you you turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the seven kingdoms that the kind of selfsacrifice that makes for a good ruler later go away and all that goes with it if it any consolation it not no i suppose not i'm terrible at consoling yes you really are all right how about the fact that this is actually happening you have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything i will renounce my lordship and my claims on highgarden it all yours for the taking are you afraid good you're in the great game now and the great game terrifying the only people who aren't afraid of failure are madman like your father do you know what frightens me i said farewell to a man who loves me a man i thought i cared for i will never marry and i felt nothing just impatient to get on with it he wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last well you have completely failed to console me for what it worth i've been a cynic for as long as i can remember everyone always asking me to believe in things family gods kings myself it was often tempting until i saw where belief got people and i will never father children so i said no thank you to belief and yet here i am i believe in you it embarrassing really i'd swear you my sword but i don't actually own a sword it your counsel i need it yours now and always good brother loras i i had something made for you i'm not sure if it right tyrion lannister i name you hand of the queen you're not one of mine are you no my lord didn't think so too pretty where are my

that the last thing you're ever going to see is a stark smiling down at you as you die forgive me my lady if you're at prayer i'm done with all that i came here every day when i was a girl i prayed to be somewhere else back then i only thought about what i wanted never about what i had i was a stupid girl against heretics and apostates you were a child what do you want i thought you knew what i wanted i was wrong no you weren't every time i'm faced with a decision i close my eyes and see the same picture whenever i consider an action i ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality pull it out of my mind i will and into the world and i only act if the answer is yes a picture of me on the iron throne and you by my side it a pretty picture news of this battle will spread quickly through the seven kingdoms i've declared for house stark for all to hear you've declared for other houses before lord baelish it never stopped you from serving yourself no i can't let them the past is gone for good you can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future you my love are the future of house stark who should the north rally behind a trueborn daughter of ned and catelyn stark born here at winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south this is where i leave you grand maester faith is the way father you're not coming with us the wall is not just ice and stone ancient spells were carved into its foundations strong magic to protect man from what lies beyond and while it stands the dead cannot pass i cannot pass where will you go the great war is

brave you are i'm not i have to go i'm i don't want to die you're not going to die get her some water no no water is there a maester listen to me ned _ if robert finds out he'll you know he will you have to protect him promise me ned i'm late for the trial promise me promise me ned promise me you can't expect knights of the vale to side with wildling invaders we didn't invade we were invited not by me the free folk the northerners and the knights of the vale fought bravely fought together and we won you mutilated him my father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield the boltons are defeated the war is over winter has come if the maesters are right it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years we should ride home and wait out the coming storms the war is not over and i promise you friend the true enemy won't wait out the storm he brings the storm you gave me your word your son was butchered at the red wedding lord manderly but you refused the call you swore allegiance to house stark lord glover but in their hour of greatest need you refused the call and you lord cerwyn your father was skinned alive by ramsay bolton still you refused the call but house mormont remembers the north remembers and i have kept my word we know no king but the king in the north whose name is stark i don't care if he a bastard ned stark blood runs through his veins he my king from this day until his last day lady mormont speaks harshly and truly my son died for robb stark the young wolf i didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime i didn't commit my man to your cause 'cause i didn't want more manderlys dying for nothing once the queen mother trial is concluded but i was wrong jon snow avenged the red wedding he is the white wolf the king in the north i did not fight beside you on the field and i will regret that until my dying day a man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness there nothing to forgive my lord there will be more fights to come brother loras is free to leave house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousand years and i will stand behind jon snow the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north company halt halt halt come on ser loras tyrell and where is the queen mother i now proclaim cersei of the house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first man protector of the seven kingdoms long may she reign long may she reign her litter never left the red keep it appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial go to the red keep and show her the way get the others where the king elsewhere i'm afraid what the meaning of this i was told that i have more important things to do with my time are you prepared to stand trial than waste them in the presence please grand maester i bear you no ill will please forgive me if you can this pains me my lord whatever your faults you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold dark place but sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to rest the longer you wait the worse it'll be for you what are you doing and profess your guilt or innocence before the seven there something wrong you have nothing to fear your grace the trial will begin shortly cersei is not here tomman is not here why do you think they're not here if the accused is not here she will be tried regardless we cannot escape the justice of the gods forget about the bloody gods and listen to what i'm telling you cersei understands the consequences of her absence there'll be no need for a trial and she is absent anyway which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences the trial can wait we all need to leave we all need to leave now loras stay with me let me through let me through get out of my way let us through confess 0
