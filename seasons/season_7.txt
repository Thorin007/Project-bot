father for 40 years and learned nothing ( seagulls screeching ) jaime: the greyjoys you invited the greyjoys to king landing not all of them well it looks like all of them i invited euron greyjoy the new king of the iron islands you said yourself we needed stronger better allies let go of me (screams) there you are how are they better allies how are they different from the freys they both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them so does everyone when it suits them unlike the freys they have ships and they're good at killing they're not good at anything i know the ironborn they're bitter angry little people all they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves euron greyjoy didn't come here for that (groans) oh what did he come here for then a queen euron: the momant i was chosen lord of the iron islands they turned on me ( chuckles ) their own uncle they stole my best ships and ran sailed them right across the world and gave them to the dragon queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you it nothing compared to the treason you suffered are you sure you're ready for this at the hands of a family member from what i hear but still it bothers me murdering them would make me feel a lot better and since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side i thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together you're not a rightful monarch though are you the greyjoys rebelled against the throne for the right to be monarchs but as i recall you were soundly defeated i'm the threeeyed raven i have to be ready for this come to mantion it weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to casterly rock and burning the lannister fleet you certainly caught us there

better chance than you swear this to me varys if you ever think i'm failing the people you won't conspire behind my back you'll look me in the eye as you have done today and you'll tell me how i'm failing them i swear it my queen and i swear this if you ever betray me i'll burn you alive i would expect nothing less from the mother of dragons gilly: that dragonglass forgive me my queen a red priestess from ashai has come to see you ( speaking valyrian ) she once served another who wanted the iron throne it didn't end well for stannis baratheon did it no it didn't you chose an auspicious day to arrive at dragonstone we've just decided to pardon those who once served the wrong king the lord of light doesn't have many followers in westeros does he a mountain of it beneath the ground not yet but even those who don't worship the lord can serve his cause what does your lord expect from me "the prince who was promised will bring the dawn " i'm afraid i'm not a prince missandei: your grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate that noun has no gender in high valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be "the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn " john needs to know doesn't really roll off the tongue does it no but i like it better and you believe this prophecy refers to me prophecies are dangerous things i believe you have a role to play as does another the king in the north jon snow jon snow ned stark bastard you know him i travelled with him to the wall when he joined the night watch you must send me away and why do you think the lord of light singled out this jon snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames that is as lord commander of the night watch he allowed the wildlings south of the wall to protect them from grave danger as king in the north he has united those wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy he sounds like quite a man summon jon snow i command you to heal yourself let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes i can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but i like jon snow and i trusted him and i am an excellent judge of character if he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally the lannisters executed his father i command you to find the cure and conspired to murder his brother jon snow has even more reason to hate cersei than you do very well send a raven north tell jon snow that his queen invites him to come to dragonstone and bend the knee ( chatter ) gather round come here sansa: you think it really tyrion so why a nice girl on her own heading to king landing it could be someone trying to lure you into a trap read the last bit "all dwarves are bastards in their father eyes " what does that mean it something he said to me the first night we met you know him better than any of us what do you think tyrion not like the other lannisters he was always kind to me but it too great a risk "the seven kingdoms will bleed i'm going to kill the queen as long as cersei sits on the iron throne join us together we can end her tyranny " sounds like a charmer of course the casual mantion of a dothraki horde a legion of unsullied and three dragons a bit less charming what fire kills wights you told me what breathes fire they have declared war on dorne i invited euron greyjoy you're not suggesting jon meet with her no too dangerous but but if the army of the dead makes it past the wall do we have enough man to fight them if the mad king daughter takes the iron throne she'll destroy the realm as we know it some of you are bannerman of house tyrell but house tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown with their help the mad king daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores the new king of the iron islands mindless unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your woman and butcher your children without a second thought this is how olenna tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty ( people murmuring ) cersei: you all remember the mad king you remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people his daughter is no different in essos her brutality is already legendary she crucified hundreds of nobleman in slaver bay the iron fleet is the greatest armada westeros has ever seen and when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons it is my solemn duty to protect the people and i will but i need your help my lords we must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her ( all murmuring ) she has three fullgrown dragons your grace the same as aegon when he conquered the seven kingdoms the

our shores the dothraki in westeros for the first time in history ( thunder crashing ) i know you don't like my sister but you have to make a choice do you fight with us or with foreign savages and eunuchs when the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south i can think of no better man than randyll tarly ebrose: the infection has spread too far you should have cut off your arm the

since robert had them removed from the throne room curious that king robert did not have them destroyed they were his trophies he couldn't keep them around i wish i could remember it they would have made him look small sometimes he would come down here and look at them i believe he brought his whores on occasion balerion the dread the beast that aegon rode across the sea his flames forged the iron throne and brought the seven kingdoms to heel powerful but not invincible apparently one of daenerys dragons i always thought this would be a homecoming was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of meereen and if they can be wounded they can be killed the finest artillators and blacksmiths in king landing have been laboring day and night your grace if you'll kindly pull that lever yara: if you want the iron throne take it we have an army a fleet and three dragons we should hit king landing now hard with everything we have the city will fall within a day doesn't feel like home if we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms it called war you don't have the stomach for it scurry back into hiding i know how you wage war we don't poison little girls here myrcella was innocent she was a lannister there are no innocent lannisters my greatest regret is that oberyn died fighting for you daenerys: that enough we won't stay on dragonstone for long lord tyrion is hand of the queen you will treat him with respect i am not here to be queen of the ashes that very nice to hear of course i can't remember a queen who was better loved than my granddaughter the common people loved her the nobles loved her and what is left of her now ashes good commoners nobles they're all just children really they won't obey you unless they fear you i'm grateful to you lady olenna for your counsel i'm grateful to all of you but you have chosen to follow me i will not attack king landing we will not attack king landing then how do you mean to take the iron throne by asking nicely daenerys: not so many lions we will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides cersei will have the iron throne but no food for her army or the people but we won't use dothraki and unsullied cersei will try to rally the lords of westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country if we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point varys: cersei controls fewer than half the seven kingdoms our army should be westerosi and i suppose we're providing the westerosi you are lady greyjoy will escort you home to sunspear and her iron fleet will ferry the dornish army back up to king landing the dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the tyrell army two great kingdoms united against cersei so your master plan is to use our armies the lords of westeros despise her forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own the unsullied will have another objective for decades house lannister has been the true power in westeros and the seat of that power is casterly rock grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock and take it do i have your support you have mine dorne is with you your grace thank you all i offer vengeance justice even before your arrival they plotted against her lady olenna may i speak with you alone ( door closes ) i realize you're here out of hatred for cersei and not love for me but i swear to you she will pay for what she done and we will bring peace back to westeros peace do you think that what we had under your father or his father or his peace never lasts my dear will you take a bit of advice from an old woman now they cry out for their true queen he a clever man your hand i've known a great many clever man i've outlived them all you know why i ignored them the lords of westeros are sheep are you a sheep no you're a dragon be a dragon they drink secret toasts to my health ( knocking on door ) grey worm: mají ( door opens ) you leave tomorrow were you going to say goodbye i will see you when i return but you don't know when that will be no one knows i wish you good fortune missandei it is hard for me to say goodbye to you people used to tell my brother that sort of thing why you know why i don't yyou are my weakness that what i am your weakness when unsullied are young the masters learn their fears one boy is scared of dogs one boy hates high places one is frightened of the ocean and he was stupid enough to believe them they make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff they throw him in the water if he learns to swim good if he drowns good either way strong unsullied but i had no fears i was never the biggest never the strongest but i was bravest always i believe it until if viserys had three dragons and an army at his back i meet missandei from the isle of naath now i have fear i do too ( sniffles ) no i want to see you please ( panting ) might be useful ch'vyalthan was a dreadful writer he'd have invaded king landing already but an excellent researcher archmaester i wondered if i and this one maester faull was quite the opposite a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells um i wanted to ask you if you're going to write histories tarly you have to do the research if you want people to read your histories you need a bit of style i'm not writing "a chronicle of the wars conquering westeros would be easy for you following the death of king robert i" so it can sit on a shelf unread what you don't like the title what would you call it then mm possibly something a bit more poetic we're not poets tarly um archmaester if i could just have a momant this is your momant use it wisely i may have found a way to treat ser jorah but you're not here to be queen of the ashes there are two recorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured i found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by archmaester pylos i'm familiar with archmaester pylos and his study of rare diseases oh you are yes and shall i tell you how he died from greyscale oh the procedure far too dangerous no which is why it now forbidden ( cart wheels squeaking ) ( door opens ) hello what are you doing ( door closes ) you're jorah

ointmant to the ( groaning ) shh shh if the great houses support your claim against cersei shh again i'm sorry but please try not to scream ( grunting ) ( shushing ) ( whimpering ) ( groans ) ( muffled shouting ) ( chatter laughter ) they say her dragons are bigger than aegon the game is won horseshit cersei just trying to frighten us i hope it true if she lays siege to king landing prices will triple as long as we get back there before they start one more round it a long ride hot pie: arry hello hot pie sit down who that for mm this is good with the tyrell army and the dornish on our

trust as much as anyone in this world he discovered proof that dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass ( all murmuring ) i received this a few days ago from dragonstone it was sent to me by tyrion lannister ( all murmuring ) he is now hand of the queen to daenerys targaryen sam: i traveled south i did she intends to take the iron throne from cersei lannister she has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed three dragons ( all murmuring ) jon: lord tyrion has invited me to dragonstone to meet with daenerys and i'm going to accept ( all shouting ) man: accept we need this dragonglass my lords and then you served the man who overthrew him we know that dragonglass can destroy both white walkers and their army we need to mine it and turn it into weapons but more importantly we need allies the night king army grows larger by the day we can't defeat them on our own we don't have the numbers daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire i need to try and persuade her to fight with us ser davos and i will ride for white harbor tomorrow i had a choice your grace then sail for dragonstone have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather the mad king invited him to king landing and roasted him alive i know that she is here to reclaim the iron throne and the seven kingdoms the north is one of those seven kingdoms this isn't an invitation; it a trap it could be but i don't believe tyrion would do that you know him he a good man your grace with respect i must agree with lady sansa serve robert baratheon or face the headman axe i remember the mad king all too well a targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a lannister all: yeah aye we called your brother king and then he rode south and lost his kingdom winter is here your grace we need the king in the north in the north man: aye ( pounding tables ) you all crowned me your king i never wanted it but you didn't serve him long i never asked for it but i accepted it because the north is my home it part of me and i will never stop fighting for it no matter the odds but the odds are against us none of you have seen the army of the dead none of you we can never hope to defeat them alone we need allies powerful allies i know it a risk but i have to take it you turned against him then send an emissary don't go yourself daenerys is a queen only a king can convince her to help us it has to be me

treat you to a dornish red the best in the world have you ever been to dorne a few times never stayed long lord varys told me about a queen in the east who a boy in every port a boy a girl depends on the port could we get some more i thought it wasn't for you i'm developing a taste for it he not your servant it fine so you're going to be queen of the iron islands once i kill my uncle and what will you be handsome before i came to power you favored my brother whatever my queen commands he'll be my advisor my protector oh i see your protector so if someone gets too close to you he might have to intervene to hold that person back until they've made their intentions known why are you standing all the way over there then a foreign invasion is underway all your spies your little birds leave him be seems like you don't need a protector ( crashing ) ( man shouting ) stay here ( all shouting ) man: we're under attack euron ( man shouting ) ( grunts ) ( yelling ) ( screams ) did they tell you viserys was cruel stupid and weak ( grunts ) ( all shouting ) ( all grunting ) you mother below deck keep her safe ( explosions ) ( footsteps approach ) ( exhales ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( man

have her come and get her ( screaming echoes ) ( choking ) ( splashes ) ( cackling ) and that you were said to be beautiful ( whimpering ) ( sniffles ) ( music playing ) so you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the dothraki which you turned to your advantage who gave the order to kill me king robert who hired the assassins who sent word to essos to murder daenerys targaryen your grace i did what had to be done to to keep yourself alive lord varys has proven himself a loyal servant spending your life reading about the achievemants proven himself loyal quite the opposite if he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one what kind of a servant is that the kind the realm needs incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty as long as i have my eyes i'll use them i wasn't born into a great house i came from nothing i was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering when i was a child i lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses 0 game of thrones s07e03 the queen justice srt i wish you all the happiness in the world son of ned stark good if you don't mind my saying i don't think you should return to westeros i'm not sure you'd be safe here oh i will return dear spider one last time my lady i have to die in this strange country just like you missandei: you stand in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen let get them inside rightful heir to the iron throne rightful queen of the andals and the first man protector of the seven kingdoms the mother of dragons the khaleesi of the great grass sea the unburnt the breaker of chains this is jon snow he king in the north thank you for traveling so far my lord i hope the seas weren't too rough tyrion lannister: for decades house lannister the winds were kind your grace apologies i have a flea bottom accent i know but jon snow is king in the north your grace he not a lord forgive me your grace this is ser davos seaworth forgive me ser davos i never did receive a formal education but i could have sworn i read the last king in the north was torrhen stark who bent the knee to my ancestor aegon targaryen has been the true power in westeros in exchange for his life and the lives of the northman torrhen stark swore fealty to house targaryen in perpetuity or do i have my facts wrong i wasn't there your grace no of course not but still an oath is an oath and perpetuity means what does perpetuity mean lord tyrion forever forever and the feat of that power is casterly rock so i assume my lord ( sighs ) you're here to bend the knee i am not oh well that is unfortunate you've traveled all this way to break faith with house targaryen break faith your father burned my grandfather alive he burned my uncle alive grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock he would have burned the seven kingdoms my father was an evil man on behalf of house targaryen i ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family and i ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father our two houses were allies for centuries and those were the best centuries the seven kingdoms have ever known and take it centuries of peace and prosperity with a targaryen sitting on the iron throne and a stark serving as warden of the north i am the last targaryen jon snow honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine bend the knee and i will name you warden of the north together we will save this country from those who would destroy it you're right you're not guilty of your father crimes summon jon snow and i'm not beholden to my ancestor vows then why are you here because i need your help and you need mine did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived i did and did you see the dothraki all of whom have sworn to kill for me they're hard to miss but still i need your help davos: not to defeat cersei tyrion: he would make a valuable ally you could storm king landing tomorrow and the city would fall hell we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons almost but you haven't stormed king landing why not the only reason i can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people it the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it which means at the very least you're better than cersei melisandre: let him stand before you and tell you the things still that doesn't explain why i need your help because right now you and i and cersei and everyone else we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair you told me you liked this man i do in the time since he met me he refused to call me queen he refused to bow and now he calling me a child i believe he calling all of us children figure of speech your grace everyone you know will die before winter over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north jaime lannister: myrcella (panting) that have happened to him as far as i can see you are the enemy to the north i am not your enemy the dead are the enemy the dead is that another figure of speech the army of the dead is on the march the army of the dead you don't know me well my lord but do you think i'm a liar or a madman no i don't think you're either of those things dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass the army of the dead is real the white walkers are real the night king is real i've seen them if they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves we're finished i was born at dragonstone not that i can remember it we fled before robert assassins could find us robert was your father best friend no we can never hope to defeat the army of the dead alone i wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib not that it matters now of course i spent my life in foreign lands so many man have tried to kill me i don't remember all their names i have been sold like a broodmare i've been chained and betrayed raped and defiled do you know what kept me standing we need allies through all those years in exile faith not in any gods not in myths and legends in myself in daenerys targaryen the world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born the dothraki hadn't crossed the sea any sea they did for me you're abandoning your people you're abandoning your home i was born to rule the seven kingdoms and i will you'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the night king the war against my sister has already begun you can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting whatever you saw beyond the wall you don't believe him i understand that it sounds like nonsense until i return the north is yours but if destiny has brought daenerys targaryen back to our shores it has also made jon snow king in the north you were the first to bring dothraki to westeros he is the first to make allies of wildlings and northman he was named lord commander of the night watch he was named king in the north not because of his birthright he has no birthright he a damn bastard all those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him ( theme music playing ) all those things you don't believe in he faced those things he fought those things for the good of his people he risked his life for his people he took a knife in the heart for his people he gave his own if we don't put aside our enmities and band together we will die and then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the iron throne if it doesn't matter then you might as well kneel the bastard of winterfell swear your allegiance to queen daenerys help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north there no time for that there no time for any of this while we stand here debating it takes no time to bend the knee pledge your sword to her cause and why would i do that i mean no offense your grace the dwarf of casterly rock but i don't know you as far as i can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father name and my own father fought to overthrow the mad king the lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them and i will continue to do so as well as i can that fair it also fair to point out that i'm the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms i believe we last saw each other atop the wall by declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom you are in open rebellion ( footsteps approaching ) ( whispering ) your grace please dismiss your guests i have grave news you must forgive my manners you'll both be tired after your long journey we'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms ( speaking dothraki ) am i your prisoner myrcella you were pissing off the edge if i remember right not yet our ironborn and dornish allies were attacked en route to dorne and two or three ships escaped the rest sunk or captured ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured the greyjoys dead or captured all of them ( man shouting ) pull heave picked up some scars along the road pull ( man grunt ) ( grunts ) your sister dead euron has her you saw him take her but you got away i couldn't save her i tried you wouldn't be here if you tried man: come man it been a long road but we're both still here sails up ( crowd cheering ) woman: murderer man: whores ( all shouting ) traitor this is the life look at them cheering for a greyjoy ( cheering ) ( grunts ) ( laughter ) i have to be honest i'm tyrion lannister this is making me hard did you see little theon face right before he jumped overboard "oh no" ( laughs ) what a twat ( crowd booing ) ( crowd shouting ) ( spits ) man: whore whore whore man ♪2: murderers ( applause ) ( grunts ) davos seaworth ah the onion knight my queen please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the iron islands ( both grunt gasp ) i give you what no other man could give justice justice for your murdered daughter you've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas and a true friend to the crown you deserve more than a true friend and you deserve a proper reward for your heroism we fought on opposite sides at the battle of blackwater bay there only one reward i want you shall have what your heart desires when the war is won with euron greyjoy commanding our naval forces and jaime lannister leading our armies the sons and daughters of westeros shall defend our country ( crowd cheering ) there nothing quite like it is there the love of the people unluckily for me though i suppose you wouldn't know this same mob spat at my sister not long ago and if you turn on us they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike or yours they just like severed heads really listen if you have any advice at all i would love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers advice missandei is the queen most trusted advisor does she like it gentle or rough a finger in the bum shh shh shh shh not now we'll talk later cersei: i want you to know i understand even though we're enemies you and i i understand the fury that drives you i was there that day when ser gregor crushed your lover head if i close my eyes i can hear the sound of oberyn skull breaking ( grunts ) welcome to dragonstone the sound of your scream i never heard a sound like that i thought "that true love " oberyn looked beautiful that day he really did no one moved like him no one had such skill with a spear even ser gregor couldn't stop him if only he hadn't taunted him he could've walked away and left poor ser gregor to die but that wasn't your lover way was it our queen knows it is a long journey now he buried somewhere and here ser gregor stronger than ever that must be difficult for you when my daughter was taken from me my only daughter well you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child i fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse i couldn't bear to see her in another woman arms (screams) she appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf i never got to have a mother but myrcella did she was mine and you took her from me why did you do that doesn't matter now your daughter a beauty too those brown eyes those lips perfect dornish beauty i imagine she your favorite if you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons i know i know we're not supposed to have favorites but still we're only human we love whom we love ( muffled speech ) i'm sorry i can't understand you that gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying it must be frustrating we all make our choices you chose to murder my daughter you must have felt powerful after you made that choice of course ( grunts ) do you feel powerful now i don't sleep very well not at all really i lie in bed and i stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies how to destroy ellaria sand the woman who murdered my only daughter i thought about having ser gregor crush your skull the way he did oberyn it would be poetic i suppose but fast too fast i thought about having him crush your daughter skull ( man murmuring ) she so beautiful the thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg no it just not right ( tyene whimpers ) ( gasps ) mama ( grunts ) ( crying ) qyburn here is the cleverest man i know clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder myrcella please this way the long goodbye was that it the long farewell that the one how long does the poison take qyburn: difficult to say hours days it depends on the subject constitution but death is certain oh yes your grace quite certain your daughter will die here in this cell and you will be here watching when she does you'll be here the rest of your days if you refuse to eat we'll force food down your throat where are you from you will live to watch your daughter rot to watch that beautiful face collapse ( sobbing ) to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made make sure the guards change the torches every few hours i don't want her to miss a thing ( both crying ) no ( panting ) ( birds chirping ) i can't place the accent ( knocking on door ) don't what are you doing no one can see us like this i am the queen of the seven kingdoms i'll do as i please forgive me your grace the visitor from braavos has arrived good and we'll need fresh sheets for the bed at once your grace ( chuckles ) ( liquid pouring ) i was born on the island of naath no thank you my condolences your grace on the death of your son from all reports he was a fine young man the iron bank didn't send you here to offer condolences condolences and congratulations to become the first ruling queen of the seven kingdoms that quite an accomplishmant the iron bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elemants ah i hear it beautiful down there who sought to subvert the rule of law the destruction of the sept of baelor was a tragic accident indeed but sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership the iron bank wants its gold back your father never minced words either but yes your debts are considerable and you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts we both know how expensive war can be and we both know gold wins wars palm trees and butterflies your vaults are empty your late husband profligacy saw to that your wealthiest allies the tyrells are now your enemies you are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne and the iron bank wants to bet on a winner we don't make bets we invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful a fancy way of saying "bet " the war already begun i've drawn first blood i decapitated the dornish snake kill us haven't been myself my armada owns the narrow sea euron greyjoy armada owns the narrow sea euron greyjoy is loyal to me for now daenerys targaryen has three fullgrown dragons how well do wooden ships fare against firebreathing dragons her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think but let talk about the targaryen girl you want to invest in her i'm guessing the iron bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade this place has changed how are your profits now that daenerys has freed all the slaves the slave trade has entered a downturn it true from what i gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary than a monarch in your experience how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries the lannisters owe the iron bank quite a lot of money but lannisters always pay their debts do former slaves or dothraki or dragons your father daughter indeed tyrion: and sansa i hear she alive and well give me a fortnight stay in king landing as my honored guest and when you return to braavos i swear to you my debt will be paid in full i came down here to brood over my failure to predict the greyjoy attack you're making it difficult you look a lot better brooding than i do you make me feel like i'm failing at brooding over failing i'm a prisoner on this island i wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island jon: she is does she miss me terribly you're free to walk the castle the beaches to go wherever you want except to my ship you took my ship i wouldn't say we took your ship i'm not playing word games with you the dead are coming for us all why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies and i'll figure out what to do about your walking dead man a sham marriage and unconsummated it hard for me to fathom it really is if someone told me about the white walkers and the night king you probably don't believe me i do actually you didn't before "grumkins and snarks " you called them do you remember you said it was all nonsense it was nonsense everybody knew it but then mormont saw them i didn't ask well it was wasn't and you saw them and i trust the eyes of an honest man more than i trust what everybody knows how do i convince people who don't know me that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all good question i know it a good question i'm looking for an answer people minds aren't made for problems that large white walkers the night king army of the dead anyway it almost a relief to confront a comfortable familiar monster like my sister i need to help prepare my people for what coming i can't help them from here i'd like to leave it seems unlikely that you became king in the north by giving up that easily everyone told me to learn from my father mistakes don't go south don't answer a summons from the mad king daughter she much smarter than she lets on a foreign invader and here i am a northern fool children are not their fathers luckily for all of us and sometimes there more to foreign invaders and northern fools than meets the eye daenerys could have sailed for westeros long ago but she didn't instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates she starting to let on some of whom are on this island with us right now while you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the mad king daughter she protects people from monsters just as you do it why she came here and she not about to head north to fight an enemy she never seen on the word of a man she doesn't know good after a single meeting it not a reasonable thing to ask so do you have anything reasonable to ask what do you mean maybe you are a northern fool i'm asking if there something i can do to help you dragonglass tyrion: yes volcanic glass obsidian he says you have a tremandous amount of it here why are we talking about glass i may have found a way to treat ser jorah tyrion: at some point we just lost two of our allies which is why i was speaking to jon snow a potential ally and what does the king in the north want with dragonglass apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers or stop them destroy them unsure about the nomanclature and what do you think about this army of the dead and white walkers and night kings i want to hear how a night watch recruit became king in the north i'd very much like to believe that jon snow is wrong but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it which wise man said this i don't remember are you trying to present your own statemants as ancient wisdom i would never do that to you the reason i believe jon snow is because he here all of his advisors would have told him not to come as long as you tell me how a lannister i would have told him not to come and he here anyway you don't have to believe him let him mine the dragonglass if he wrong it worthless you didn't even know it was here it nothing to you give him something by giving him nothing take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally became hand to daenerys targaryen keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand casterly rock what was that ser davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people did you notice that you must allow them their flights of fancy it dreary in the north ( screeching ) amazing thing to see i named them for my brothers viserys and rhaegar a long and bloody tale they're both gone now you lost two brothers as well people thought dragons were gone forever but here they are perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know you've been talking to tyrion he is my hand he enjoys talking we all enjoy what we're good at i don't you know i'm not going to let cersei stay on the iron throne i never expected that you would to be honest i was drunk for most of it and i haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to that throne i haven't either ( sighs ) i will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it any resources or man you need i will provide for you thank you so you believe me then about the night king and the army of the dead you'd better get to work jon snow ( chatter ) my bannerman think i'm a fool for coming here how much do we have 4 000 bushels my lady what does that mean for the current occupants of the castle it enough food for a year perhaps more and what the longest winter in the past hundred years uh i'm not entirely certain ii'll check maester luwin records he kept a copy of every raven scroll you're telling me we don't have enough food of course they do especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend winterfell no my lady most likely not then we must prepare for that eventuality whatever direction the threat comes from this is the best place to be we need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipmants from every keep in the north if we don't use it by winter end we'll give it back to them but if the entire north has to flee to winterfell they won't have enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them if i was your hand i would have advised against it very wise my lady maester wolkan you'll see to it are they covering those breastplates in leather no my lady well shouldn't they be once the real cold comes they should indeed pardon me my lady you there why isn't there leather on these command suits you the northerners are all facing north general rule of thumb worried about the threat from beyond the wall so they should be i know cersei better than anyone here if you turn your back on her you don't know cersei better than anyone here i only meant to say that the woman who murdered my mother father and brother is dangerous thank you for your wise counsel one of two things will happen either the dead will defeat the living in which case please try not to scream stark man don't fare well when they travel south all our troubles come to an end or life will win out and what then don't fight in the north or the south fight every battle everywhere always in your mind everyone is your enemy everyone is your friend every possible series of events is happening all at once live that way and nothing will surprise you everything that happens will be something true that you've seen before lady sansa at the gate ( people murmuring ) hello sansa ( sobbing ) i wish jon were here yes i need to speak to him you're father last living trueborn son you're lord of winterfell now i can never be lord of winterfell but i'm not a stark i can never be lord of anything i'm the threeeyed raven i don't know what that means it difficult to explain try please for me it means i can see everything everything that ever happened to everyone everything that happening right now it all pieces now fragmants i need to learn to see better ( screeching ) when the long night comes again i need to be ready how do you know all this the threeeyed raven taught me i thought you were the threeeyed raven i told you it difficult to explain ( sighs ) bran i'm sorry for all that happened to you i'm sorry it had to happen here in our home ( panting ) it was so beautiful that night snow falling just like now and you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress i have to go back inside bran i'll stay a bit longer ( man coughing in distance ) hmm hmm does it hurt i'd say you get used to them a bit less than before the infection no longer appears to be active ( sighs ) unusual unlikely one could almost be forgiven for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent don't know anything about that i just started feeling better but you never really do i assumed it was the rest that did it and the climate the climate you're free to go ser this chamber is needed for the infectious which you are no longer tarly i'd like to speak with you in my study this evening how bad is it suppose i'll find out this evening where will you go ( grunts ) come their mother is waiting for you i surrendered to this sickness the momant i first saw it i knew it would kill me or i'd kill myself before it could daenerys stormborn convinced me otherwise the only place for me is back with her i owe her my life her and you ( chuckles ) your father saved me more than once it the least i could do i wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests perhaps our paths will cross again i hope they do ebrose: you treated him yes who told you to treat him no one who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him i seem to remember you but you treated him anyway i did yes i forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful especially on someone of that age you begged us to summon the king in the north you could have infected yourself and others you could have devastated the entire citadel but you didn't it a meticulous difficult procedure many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed yet you succeeded how i read the books and followed the instructions that man is alive because of you (grunting) don't you want to see him again you should be proud thank you archmaester come here all these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away i need you to make copies of them you were expecting a reward your reward is not being immediately expelled from the citadel you'd better get started and careful of the paper mites they like flesh as well i've done my part we need to find euron greyjoy fleet and sink it your grace he already destroyed a good portion of our fleet to send our remaining ships after him i'm not talking about sending our ships after him would you have to go yourself euron ships could be anywhere or in more than one place you'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long i wouldn't be alone i've brought ice and fire together i would have drogon viserion and rhaegal what can anyone do to them missandei: they can still do something to you it only takes one arrow it too great a risk you're too important what about casterly rock the unsullied will be there soon and what will they face a difficult situation they know we're coming strange yes cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy house lannister she will be ready no one has ever taken the rock man: archers tyrion: the lannister army is still the army my father built come on tyrion: welltrained and wellprovisioned 10 000 man at least they will see us coming they will be ready ( man shouting ) you spoke so highly of jon snow man: draw loose man ♪2: loose tyrion: the gates of casterly rock are impregnable ( man grunting ) the fight up the walls will be hard we will be at a disadvantage ( grunts ) many man will die just as my father said they would interesting thing about my father he built our house up from near ruin he built our army he built casterly rock as we know it but when he arrives you hide on a cliff but he didn't build the sewers that was beneath him so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find me he was right i was low the company i kept low woman mostly they weren't welcome at the rock father disapproved of that sort of behavior couldn't walk them through the front gates i didn't take you for a bashful girl i couldn't have them in my chambers so in the process of building the sewers i threw in something for myself it was a passage that began in an out of the way cove by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers no better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground casterly rock is an impregnable fortress ( grunts wheezes ) but as a good friend of mine once said my time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end "give me 10 good man and i'll impregnate the bitch " ( grunting ) ( all shouting ) and so it begins they will face the bulk of the lannister forces they will be outnumbered they will have less armor and fewer weapons but my sister armies fight for her out of fear the unsullied will be fighting for something greater they will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them oh i doubt that they will be fighting for you and that is why they will triumph ( speaking valyrian ) ( grey worm speaking valyrian ) ( distant explosions ) where are they where are the rest of the lannisters ( man shouting ) ( chatter ) ( door opens ) give us common folk one taste of power it done it is and now the rains weep o'er our halls did we fight well uh as well as could be expected it was never our forte golden roses indeed your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending casterly rock the truth is casterly rock isn't worth much anymore well it is to me meera reed: this is brandon stark we're like the lion who tasted man but my fond childhood memories won't keep cersei on the throne so you just let them take it for now they won't be able to hold it euron greyjoy navy burned their ships we emptied the larders before we left eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across westeros and you took your army your real army and went where they weren't nothing is ever so sweet again as robb stark did to me at whispering wood there are always lessons in failures yes you must be very wise by now my father always said i was a slow learner if he was so clever why didn't he take highgarden the momant your gold mines ran dry ( scoffs ) i suppose i'll be able to ask him myself soon enough no more learning from my mistakes eh neither of us is common folk anymore how will you do it with that sword that was joffrey sword wasn't it not that he ever used it what did he call it widow wail he really was a cunt wasn't he i did unspeakable things to protect my family or watched them being done on my orders i never lost a night sleep over them i did not part on good terms they were necessary and whatever i imagined necessary for the safety of house tyrell i did but your sister has done things i was incapable of imagining that was my prize mistake a failure of imagination she a monster you do know that to you i'm sure to others as well with the king in the north or his advisor but after we've won and there no one left to oppose us when people are living peacefully in the world she built do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it you love her you really do love her you poor fool she'll be the end of you possibly not much to be gained from discussing it with you though is there why what better person to discuss it with what better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room but perhaps you're right if she driven you this far it gone beyond your control yes it has she a disease i regret my role in spreading it because of mistakes i made you will too i think we're done here how will it happen cersei had several ideas whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the red keep flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of king landing i talked her out of those will there be pain no i made sure of that terrible mistakes that good i'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck foam and bile spilling from my mouth eyes bloodred skin purple must have been horrible for you as a kingsguard as a father it was horrible enough for me a shocking scene not at all what i intended i would only be a distraction if i stayed you see i had never seen the poison work before tell cersei i want her to know it was me ( music playing ) so where will you go volantis 0 game of thrones s07e04 the spoils of war srt (grunting) randyll tarly: she has three fullgrown dragons your grace we must devise a way to raise their spirits yes perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture my only venture at this momant is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it i see a great deal of potential in that venture i imagine it would require outside investmant it will indeed i need to expand my armies my navies how do you propose to stop them my hand qyburn has made overtures to the golden company in essos i know them well they have helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears that good to hear i too would like them to recover some things that belong to me rest assured your grace you can count on the iron bank support hmm as soon as the gold arrives ( fire crackling ) we are currently at work on a solution littlefinger: this is for you the last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat but your mother fought him off the other dagger the one that took her life i would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if i could have i wasn't there for her when she needed me most but i am here for her now to do what she would have done (thudding) to protect her children anything i can do for you brandon you need only ask do you know who this belonged to no that very question was what started the war of the five kings in a way that dagger made you what you are today forced from your home driven out to the wilds beyond the wall i imagine you've seen things most man wouldn't believe (horse braying) to go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world i can only imagine chaos is a ladder ( door opens ) ( exhales ) i'm sorry to have disturbed you lord stark i'm not lord stark what that maester wolkan built it for me hot pie: i thought you'd be heading for winterfell so i can move around more easily it a very good idea you're leaving i don't want to leave you but when when they come i need to be with my family and you're safe well as safe as anyone can be now you don't need me anymore no i don't jon snow came down from castle black that all you've got to say thank you thank you for helping me my brother died for you hodor and summer died for you i almost died for you bran i'm not really not anymore ( crying ) with a wildling army and won the battle of the bastards i remember what it felt like to be brandon stark but i remember so much else now you died in that cave i did the kitchen girl the redhead with the behind the only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver 'ey up where you going in there i live here ( snickers ) fuck off i'm arya stark this is my home he king of the north now

one way or another if i'm not who i say i am i won't last long but if i am and sansa finds out you turned me away i lost this dagger commander: your sister dead right you sit there right there don't move right go tell lady stark i'll watch her henk: i ain't telling lady stark you can tell her koner: why me henk: you're gonna tell her i'm not 'cause if you don't i'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face as hard as i can koner: we told her to wait theon: euron has her ( sighs ) we were standing right next to her and and and when we turned around she'd gone my lady she she was nothing some winter town girl she comes in asking for uh ser rodrick rodrick yeah luwin yeah and maester luwin ( henk stammering ) and don't trouble yourself over it my lady we'll we'll find her you don't have to

guards ( chuckles ) it suits you lady stark jon left you in charge he did i hope he comes back soon you wouldn't be here if you'd tried i remember how happy he was to see me when he sees you his heart will probably stop ( chuckles ) it doesn't look like him should've been carved by someone who knew his face everyone who knew his face is dead we're not they say you killed joffrey did you i wish i had what about casterly rock hmm me too i was angry when i heard someone else had done it however long my list got he was always first your list of people i'm going to kill how did you get back to winterfell it a long story i imagine yours is too yes not a very pleasant one (roaring) mine neither but our stories aren't over yet no they're not arya bran home too ( crows cawing ) you came home i saw you at the crossroads you saw me i see quite a lot now (grunting) bran has visions i thought you might go to king landing so did i why would you go back there cersei on her list of names who else is on your list most of them are dead already where did you get this littlefinger gave it to me littlefinger he here tycho nestoris: we both know how expensive war can be he has declared for house stark why would he give you a dagger he thought i'd want it sansa: why because it was meant to kill me the cutthroat after your fall why would a cutthroat have a valyrian steel dagger someone very wealthy wanted me dead he not a generous man he wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back your vaults are empty it doesn't matter what do you mean it doesn't matter i don't want it are you sure arya: it valyrian steel it wasted on a cripple ( people chattering ) ( bleating ) catelyn stark would be proud you kept your vow i did next to nothing my debt will be paid in full you're too hard on yourself my lady i'm not a thank you podrick ( raven cawing ) ( waves crashing ) your grace there still no word from the unsullied soon he will come back to you he'd better what happened to whom how will it happen many things many things ( sighs ) jon: your grace ( speaks dothraki ) ( seagulls screeching ) i wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits well this is it all we'll ever need there is something else i want to show you your grace the children of the forest made these will there be pain when a very long time ago they were right here standing where we're standing before there were targaryens or starks or lannisters maybe even before there were man no they were here together the children and the first man doing what fighting each other they fought together against their common enemy jaime: no i'll make sure of that despite their differences despite their suspicions together we need to do the same if we're going to survive because the enemy is real it always been real and you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons no i don't think i can i will fight for you i will fight for the north i'd hate to die like your son when you bend the knee my people won't accept a southern ruler not after everything they've suffered they will if their king does they chose you to lead them they chose you to protect them isn't their survival more important than your pride what is it we took casterly rock not at all what i intended that very good to hear isn't it you'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves perhaps you will stay all my allies are gone they've been taken from me while i've been sitting here on this island you still have the largest armies who won't be able to eat because cersei has taken all the food from the reach tyrion: call grey worm and the unsullied back we still have enough ships to carry the dothraki to the mainland tell cersei commit to the blockade of king landing we have a plan it still the right plan the right plan your strategy has lost us dorne the iron islands and the reach if i have underestimated our enemies our enemies your family you mean perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all ( dragons screeching ) enough with the clever plans i have three large dragons i'm going to fly them to the red keep i want her to know it was me we've discussed this my enemies are in the red keep what kind of a queen am i if i'm not willing to risk my life to fight them a smart one what do you think i should do i would never presume to i'm at war i'm losing what do you think i should do jon: i never thought that dragons would exist again no one did ( theme music playing ) the people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen build a world that different from the shit one they've always known but if you use them to melt castles and burn cities you're not different you're just more of the same ( dragons screeching ) ( horse neighs ) ( both grunting ) ( huffs ) don't lunge ( grunting ) don't go where your enemy leads you brienne: up and don't don't fight someone like her in the first place nice sword very nice dagger if they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then i'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought man: hold that wagon we can't it been a while since i trained i can go and find the master of arms for you my lady he didn't beat the hound you did i want to train with you you swore to serve both my mother daughters didn't you brienne: move aside podrick you can't use that my lady it too small tyrion lannister ( horses neighing ) i won't cut you don't worry i'll try not to ( grunting ) ( grunts shouts ) ( shouting ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( exhales ) who taught you how to do that no one ( waves crashing ) you've just won the biggest prize in the world ( seagulls screeching ) davos: what do you think of her who ( sighs ) i believe you know of whom i speak i think she has a good heart a good heart i've noticed you staring at her good heart there no time for that i saw the night king davos i looked into his eyes how many man do we have in the north to fight him 10 000 less what could you possibly have to be upset about fewer what speaking of good hearts missandei of naath ser davos lord snow king snow isn't it no that doesn't sound right king jon it doesn't matter forgive me but may i ask a question of course your name is jon snow but your father name was ned stark i'm a bastard come on you can tell me my mother and father weren't married is the custom different in naath we don't have marriage in naath so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist that sounds liberating why did you leave your homeland i was stolen away by slavers i'm sorry if i may how did a slave girl come to advise daenerys targaryen queen of thorns give you one last prick in the balls she bought me from my master and set me free davos: that was good of her of course you're serving her now aren't you i serve my queen because i want to serve my queen because i believe in her and if you wanted to sail home to naath tomorrow then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune you believe that i know it all of us who came with her from essos before saying goodbye we believe in her she not our queen because she the daughter of some king we never knew she the queen we chose will you forgive me if i switch sides ( bell ringing ) jon: is that a greyjoy ship ( man shouting ) ( man shouts ) man: halt i'll save my confessions for the high septon jon i didn't know you were here ssansa is she all right what you did for her is the only reason i'm not killing you we heard your uncle attacked your fleet we thought you were dead i should be davos: your sister there is no more high septon euron has her i came to ask the queen to help me get her back the queen is gone where did she go man: get the horses watered ( neighs ) ( chatter ) all the gold safely through the gates of king landing good we need to get the last of these wagons over the blackwater rush before nightfall no there isn't is

give them fair warning first these man fought well at highgarden ( man grunting ) man: now get it on this thing man ♪2: lift ( man laughing ) ser jaime rickon there is still the question of my prize dickon i hear you fought bravely at highgarden your first battle and it was glorious come on your father not here all my life we've been pledged to house tyrell i knew some of those man i hunted with them they didn't deserve to die but lady olenna chose to betray her queen take a step toward a more productive relationship that a lot of money i just gave you and support the targaryen girl so here we are i didn't expect it to smell like that man shit themselves when they die didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school well i learned it when i was five ( distant horse neighs ) what listen (

not to me ser bronn of the blackwater formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid when we win this war all the castles in the seven kingdoms i will allow you to mine the dragonglass will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you yes i'm sure queen cersei reign will be quiet and peaceable ah stranger things have happened like what the granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons my lord the current harvest we have teams of man collecting it from all the farms in the reach ser bronn will you accompany the tarlys and forge weapons from it and help them accelerate this process i'm not much for shoveling wheat no but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest i bet you're going to have a real talent for that my lord my lord my lord tycho: i must say i don't think the iron bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installmant i always considered your father a very effective and efficient man thank you but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely you're too kind my lord i am neither kind nor a lord your grace i am merely an instrumant of the institution i represent its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic not sentimant and the current arithmetic is outstanding uh the gold is on its way my brother is supervising its transportation himself some at the iron bank will be disappointed they've grown rather fond of your interest paymants 0 game of thrones s07e05 eastwatch srt clegane look into the flames closest castle to hardhome is

to die dracarys ( both screaming ) ( man shouts ) ( drogon roaring ) ( door closes ) my my lord how many man did we lose arya stark: this suits you lady stark we haven't done a full accounting it not only armies that win wars we have the tyrell gold we have the iron bank behind us we can buy mercenaries not the same as our man but they'll fight if they're well paid which they will be i just saw the dothraki fight they'll beat any mercenary army they'll beat any army i've ever seen killing our man wasn't war for them it was sport jon left you in charge he did her dragon burnt a thousand wagons qyburn scorpion fired bolts bigger than you they couldn't stop it and she has three of them this isn't a war we can win so what do we do sue for peace i sit on her father throne the father you betrayed and murdered and in her mind she winning what sort of offer do you think she'd make (grunting) maybe we can count on tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and son he didn't you saw the crossbow you saw his body i'm not talking about father tyrion didn't kill joffrey he had nothing to do with it after all this time it still amazes me that you it was olenna she confessed before she died and this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her jaime lannister: lord tarly i believe you know my son after and you believed her if you were olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to joffrey or tomman which one would margaery have been better able to control which one would have made olenna the true ruler of the seven kingdoms she was telling the truth i shouldn't have listened to you she should have died screaming do you fight with us she dead like her son her grandchildren her whole house and if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them so we fight and die or we submit and die i know my choice a soldier should know his ( drogon screeching ) ( roaring ) ( snarling ) ( snarling stops )

matter how big they get or how terrifying to everyone else they're my children daenerys targaryen: what do you think i should do you weren't gone long no and and i have fewer enemies today than i did yesterday you're not sure how you feel about that no i'm not how many man did your army kill taking winterfell back from the boltons thousands we both want to help people what do you see if you use them to melt castles and burn cities we can only help them from a position of strength sometimes strength is terrible when you first came here ser davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people ser davos gets carried away so it was a figure of speech ( footsteps approaching ) ( speaking dothraki ) your grace jon snow this is ser jorah mormont you're not different an old friend i served with your father he was a great man you look strong you found a cure i wouldn't be here if i hadn't i return to your service my queen if you'll have me it would be my honor ( ravens cawing )

one else could not the night watch not the wildlings no one perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind i sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming ( clears throat ) everyone in westeros trusts and respects you if you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it (dragon growls) if you advise all the lords to send their man north to hold the wall they'll do it and if you tell every maester in the citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night they may find something that lets us defeat the army of the dead for good it could be done and this news could be authentic it possible ( theme music playing ) it also possible that this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest sandhu: that does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples archmaester please it real i've seen it we will write to maester wolkan ( insects chirping ) at winterfell for clarification i promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another archmaester please that will be all tarly maester: it brings to mind the work of jenny of oldstones the charlatan who claimed descent from the children of the forest ( all chuckling ) sandhu: don't forget the prophet lodos who promised that the drowned god would rise up and destroy aegon the conqueror ( all laugh ) ah lodos is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive i'm afraid so ( gasps grunts ) horrible business i haven't had the heart to tell him yet he a good lad right the ravenry was falling apart the last time i checked ( slurping ) all rulers demand that people bend the knee that why they're rulers she gave tarly a choice a man who had taken up arms against her ( gasping ) what else could she do not burn him alive alongside his son i am her hand not her head i can't make her decisions for her that what i used to tell myself about her father i found the traitors but i wasn't the one burning them alive i was only a purveyor of information it what i told myself when i watched them beg for mercy i'm not the one doing it when the pitch of their screams rose higher the hound: a wall of ice ( grunts ) i'm not the one doing it when their hair caught fire and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room i'm not the one doing it ( sighs ) daenerys is not her father and she never will be with the right counsel you need to find a way to make her listen who that for jon snow ( gasping ) did you read it it a sealed scroll for the king in the north what it say nothing good i thought arya was dead i thought bran was dead i'm happy for you you don't look happy bran saw the night king and his army marching towards eastwatch ( coughing panting ) if they make it past the wall the wall has kept them out for thousands of years presumably i need to go home you said you don't have enough man we'll fight with the man we have unless you'll join us and give the country to cersei as soon as i march away she marches in perhaps not cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story you could've killed me made up by wet nurses to frighten children what if we prove her wrong i don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation so bring the dead to her i thought that was what we were trying to avoid we don't have to bring the whole army only one soldier is that possible the first wight i ever saw was brought into castle black from beyond the wall the fuck were you doing back there bring one of these things down to king landing and show her the truth anything you bring back will be useless unless cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the momant we set foot in the capital the only person she listens to is jaime he might listen to me and how would you get into king landing i can smuggle you in ending the war but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you i'm warning you i'm not a fighter well it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead man fair point how do you propose to find one with the queen permission i'll go north and take one you asked me to find a cure so i could serve you allow me to serve you the free folk will help us killing her they know the real north better than anyone they won't follow ser jorah they won't have to you can't lead a raid beyond the wall you're not in the night watch anymore you're king in the north i'm the only one here who fought them i'm the only one here who knows them i haven't given you permission to leave with respect your grace i don't need your permission i am a king you saw the dragon between you and her and i came here knowing that you could have your man behead me or your dragons burn me alive i put my trust in you a stranger because i knew it was the best chance for my people for all our people now i'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it our best chance ( all chattering ) glover: the king in the north should stay in the north and ( grunts ) we did not choose you to rule us my lady but perhaps we should have ( all murmuring ) the knights of the vale came here for you lady stark man: aye you are very kind my lords but jon is our king he is doing what he thinks is best ( chatter ) sansa: i warned jon this would happen that he couldn't leave the north listen to me cunt and expect it to just sit and wait for him like ghost he didn't he trusted you to hold it for him well he not making it easy the northern lords are proud these are mother and father chambers and nothing don't do that what say what you mean you always liked nice things they made you feel better than everyone the wall till i get what i'm owed are you angry with me they were insulting jon and you sat there and listened i listened to their complaints which is my responsibility as lady of winterfell their opinions are important to you glover has 500 man royce has 2 000 offend them and jon loses his army not if they lose their heads first winterfell didn't just fall into our hands a dragon doesn't get to kill you we took it back and the mormonts and the hornwoods and the wildlings and the vale all of us working together now i'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying but that not the way you get people to work together and if jon doesn't come back you'll need their support so you can work together to give you what you really want you don't get to kill you how can you even think such a horrible thing you're thinking it right now you don't want to be but the thought just won't go away i have work to do my lady ( door opens closes ) last time i was here i killed my father with a crossbow last time i was here you killed my son with wildfire there a path to the left that hugs the cliff only i get to kill you the guards hardly ever patrol it too many steps you're not staying here i've got my own business in flea bottom what if someone takes the boat then we're fucked best hurry we don't have time for this we should be preparing the city for a siege the dothraki are coming all the more reason for you to train that was only one of them unless you plan on fighting dothraki 12yearolds well i seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well and here i am ready to train why down here i don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet today might be the day i kill you by accident oh you won't be swinging it at me i'll leave you to it i needed to see you she has two more and i knew you'd never agree to meet you made me look like a complete fool i thought i'd surprise you by hitting casterly rock but you were three steps ahead of me abandoned the family home completely unsentimantal father would have been proud don't talk about father listen to me i once told bronn that if i ever saw you again i'd cut you in half it'll take you a while with a sparring sword if she decides to use them to really use them he was going to execute me he knew i was innocent he didn't hate me because of anything i did he hated me because of what i am a little monster sent to punish him did he did he think did he think i wanted to be born this way did he think i chose it what do you want daenerys will win this war you're a military man you're fucked don't you mean we're fucked you must know there no way around that daenerys is not her father she even willing to suspend the hostilities if cersei agrees to certain terms if you want cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself i i don't and daenerys doesn't not right now anyway she has a more important request ( chatter ) no i do not i wasn't sure i'd find you thought you might still be rowing ( chuckles ) i looked in shops taverns brothels should have known to come straight to the street of steel aren't you worried about the gold cloaks haven't been here in years why should they recognize me sometimes i hardly do nothing fucks you harder than time dragons are where our partnership ends anybody give you any trouble here i am arming lannisters and i never get a second look but you were right safest place for me was right under the queen nose don't be so sure safety is never a permanent state of affairs bad things are coming you came to get me you want me to come with you well the thing you need to understand is i'm ready the only thing standing between us i'm not gonna be around when those things you let go you should know what you're heading into what do you think i've been thinking about with every swing of the hammer how happy i am making weapons for the family that killed my father the family that tried to kill me ( scoffs ) i've been getting ready i never knew what for start spitting fire on king landing but i've always known i'd know it when it comes you might want to bring one of those swords i don't know much about swinging swords but this this i know keep your father name to yourself situation complicated enough already well who should i say i am i told you clovis if we don't get out of here soon someone going to gold cloak: you there i have to tell cersei no weapons friends i promise what can i do for you is that your boat it is gold cloak: the docks are that way davos: that they are i try to stay away from them to avoid good man such as yourselves still five gold dragons ( laughs ) are you joking you must be even older than you look 15 15 apiece may as well jump back in that river ( sighs ) ( coins jingling ) i can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you gold cloak ♪2: what in the boat not more gold wine mm i like wine or hams come have a look fermanted crab what davos: fermanted crab one bucket of this triples a brothel earnings for the week ( man shouting in distance ) a man thinks he done he ready to go back to his loving family but before he gets his breeches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth five minutes later he back in the race here have a taste i'd hurry to your favorite establishmant or you'll put a hole in that chainmail ( laughing ) ( chattering ) ( shouting continues ) oi dwarf i really wouldn't try any more until you see how the first bite hits you that dwarf where'd you get that scar fish hook some man you just can't teach we was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back davos: perhaps there some arrangemant ( coins jingle ) arrangemant ( drogon screeches ) you gonna arrange to pay us more than queen cersei ( grunting ) ( sighs ) this is gendry he'll do go go go qyburn: i could give you something that won't be necessary ser jaime ( door closes ) why was qyburn here he the hand of the queen why are you here ( roaring ) i met with tyrion what did our brother have to say daenerys wants to meet to discuss her surrender to discuss an armistice she just won a great victory why would she want a truce now because an army of dead man is marching on the seven kingdoms tyrion claims he'll have proof ( chuckles ) i know what cersei has told you are you going to punish him tyrion bronn he betrayed you he set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing you let it happen why i've come to believe that an accommodation with the dragon queen could be in our immediate interest that i've come to destroy your cities she has the numbers if we want to beat her we have to be clever we have to fight her like father would have dead man dragons and dragon queens whatever stands in our way we will defeat it for ourselves for our house for this who will you say is the father you people won't like that and the army of the dead is the wall burn down your homes do you remember what father used to say about people the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep never betray me again davos: we're leaving today the king got a lot on his mind i understand he doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king you don't have to worry you're just clovis a smith who come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the winterfell forges understood murder you and orphan your children ( hammering ) ( chatter ) begging your pardon your grace you survived king landing yet again your grace this is clo name gendry your grace i'm robert baratheon son bastard son he was meant to keep that to himself our fathers trusted each other why shouldn't we that cersei lannister not me i saw your father once at winterfell i met yours in my shop you're a lot leaner and you're a lot shorter i grew up on stories about them all i ever knew is that they fought together and won ser davos told me where you're going your grace and why let me come with you don't be a fool you're not a soldier no but i'm a fighter and he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that i'm not here to murder you know how to use one well that a problem i prefer a hammer he can handle himself we could use the help as my father used to say "it better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life " i owe you my life twice over and all i want to destroy but if what you said is true about what up there i can't wait out this war yeah nobody mind me all i've ever done is live to a ripe old age man: all right come on ( grunts ) tyrion: you may not believe it but i've missed you mormont nobody glowers quite like you not even grey worm is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor this is the coin the slaver gave me when i suggested he free us and pay us remember it was supposed to last us the rest of our lives take it with you but bring it back our queen needs you we should be better at saying farewell by now your grace i if i don't return at least you won't have to deal with the king in the north anymore to the benefit of no one but the cersei lannisters of the world i've grown used to him i wish you good fortune in the wars to come your grace heave ( fire crackling ) gilly: do you know how many steps there are in the citadel no 15 782 guess how many windows are in the great sept of baelor none anymore that true i offer you a choice this high septon maynard he recorded everything he even recorded his own bowel movemants what does "annulmant" mean it when a man sets aside his lawful wife maynard says here that he issued an annulmant for a prince "ragger" and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in dorne is that a common thing in the south or these maesters they set me to the task of preserving that man window counting bend the knee and join me and annulmants and bowel movemants for all eternity while the secret to defeating the night king probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored but that all right isn't it we can all become slavering murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of high septon maynard 15 782 shits steps that number was the steps ( giggles ) together we will leave the world a better place than we found it are you sure you want to do this you always wanted to be a maester i'm tired of reading about the achievemants of better man ( whispering ) ( horse whinnies ) ( dog barking ) ( quiet chatter ) wolkan: i found it my lord it uh took some searching maester luwin archives are very thorough you're sure this is the only copy in winterfell and the wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries or refuse uh yes my lord lady stark thanks you for your service ( door closes lock clicks ) tormund: isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this i've been failing at that job of late how many queens are there now two and you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother and die ( chuckles ) both how many man did you bring jon: not enough the big woman we were hoping some of your man could help hmm i'll be staying behind i'm a liability out there as you well know you are you really want to go out there again ( snarls ) you're not the only ones my scouts found them a mile south of the wall said they were on their way here you're the hound i saw you once at winterfell they want to go beyond the wall too we don't want to go beyond the wall we have to our lord told us that the great war is coming gendry: don't trust him don't trust any of them ( roaring ) they're the brotherhood and the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a red witch to be murdered jorah: thoros i hardly recognized you ser jorah mormont they won't give me anything to drink down here i haven't been feeling like myself tormund: you're a fucking mormont like the last lord commander step forward my lord he was my father he hunted us like animals you returned the favor as i recall ( growls ) here we all are at the edge of the world at the same momant heading in the same direction for the same reason our reasons aren't your reasons it doesn't matter what we think our reasons are you will not kneel there a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not we may take the steps but the lord of light for fuck sake will you shut your hole are we coming with you or not don't you want to know what we're doing is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die he right we're all on the same side i already have a queen how can we be we're all breathing ( gate rumbling ) ( wind howling ) ( music playing ) tyrion: my sister she wasn't your queen until recently though was she last time we saw the night king when she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed house tyrell for all time so it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible there are no easy choices in war say what you will about your sister she was born in westeros she lived here all her life you on the other hand murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader it was at hardhome one with no ties to this land with an army of savages at her back you will not trade your honor for your life i respect that perhaps he could take the black your grace whatever else he is he is a true soldier he'd be invaluable at the wall you cannot send me to the wall you are not my queen you will have to kill me too 0 game of thrones s07e06 beyond the wall srt lord varys: your father has proved to be an awful traitor (dragon growling) your father wanted to execute me you know i heard he was in the right of course didn't make me hate him any less i'm glad he didn't catch you me too your father gave me this sword changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf but it still longclaw lord commander mormont thought you'd never come back to westeros tyrion lannister: daenerys is not her father but you are back and it been in your family for centuries it not right for me to have it he gave it to you i'm not his son i brought shame onto my house i broke my father heart i forfeited the right to claim this sword it yours may it serve you well varys: and she never will be with the right counsel and your children after you ( sighs ) ( chatter ) father used to watch us from up here he wouldn't say much you probably don't remember you were inside knitting all the time i remember one time the boys were shooting arrows with ser rodrik i came out here after i am her hand not her head and bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground ser rodrik would have cuffed him if he saw there was one arrow in the target there was no one around just like now no one to stop me so i started shooting and every shot i had to go up there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again i wasn't very good i can't make her decisions for her finally i hit the bulleye could have been the 20th shot or the 50th i don't remember but i hit the bulleye and i heard this i looked up and he standing right here smiling down at me i knew what i was doing was against the rules but he was smiling so i knew it wasn't wrong the rules were wrong you need to find a way to make her listen i was doing what i was meant to be doing and he knew it now he dead killed by the lannisters with your help what that your pretty handwriting septa mordane used to crack my knuckles 'cause i couldn't write as well as you "robb i write to you today with heavy heart our good king robert is dead jeor mormont: it called longclaw it was my father sword killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt " you don't have to read it i remember "father has been charged with treason he conspired with robert brothers against my beloved joffrey and tried to steal his throne the lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort i beg you come to king landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses it was meant for my son jorah of lannister and stark your faithful sister sansa " they forced me to do it did they with a knife at your throat did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop you don't know what it was like i was a child so was i i would have let them kill me before i betrayed my family they told me it was the only way to save father he brought dishonor to our house and you were stupid enough to believe them i remember you standing on that platform with joffrey and cersei when they dragged father to the block i remember the pretty dress you were wearing i remember the fancy way you did your hair you were there i was there standing in the crowd near baelor statue and what did you do did you come running to the rescue but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled did you fight off the lannisters and save father i wanted to but you didn't just like me i didn't betray him i didn't betray robb i didn't betray our entire family for my beloved joffrey you should be on your knees thanking me we're standing in winterfell again because of me you didn't win it back jon didn't win it back he lost the battle of the bastards the knights of the vale won the battle and they rode north for me the girl is innocent she should be given a chance from westeros while you were off where traveling the world i was training training well while you were training i suffered things you could never imagine oh i don't know about that i can imagine quite a lot you never would have survived what i survived i guess we'll never know what are you going to do with that letter i don't know yet who did you show it to where did you find it clegane look into the flames what do you see you're scared aren't you what are you scared of you didn't commit any crimes no one going to hang you well arya you're scared i'll show it to jon and he'll be angry no that not jon he'll understand you were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked lannisters do you know how happy cersei would be right now if she saw us fighting this is exactly what she wants (fire crackling) this is what she always wanted to tear us apart you're scared the northern lords will read it they wouldn't think much of lady sansa if they knew how she did cersei bidding what would little lyanna mormont say she younger than you were when you wrote this are you going to say "but i was just a child" you're angry sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things there a mountain looks like an arrowhead i'll go with anger you're the one they call "the dog " fuck off ( chuckles ) they told me you were mean were you born mean or you just hate wildings i don't give two shits about wildings it gingers i hate gingers are beautiful we are kissed by fire just like you don't point your fucking finger at me the dead are marching past thousands of 'em did you trip into the fire when you were a baby i didn't trip i was pushed and ever since you've been mean will you fuck off i don't think you're truly mean you have sad eyes you want to suck my dick is that it dick cock ah dick i like it tyrion: cersei thinks the army of the dead i bet you do nope it pussy for me i have a beauty waiting for me back at winterfell if i ever get back there yellow hair blue eyes the tallest woman you've ever seen almost as tall as you brienne of tarth you know her you're with brienne of fucking tarth well not with her yet is nothing but a story but i see the way she looks at me how does she look at you like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver you do know her we've met i want to make babies with her think of them great big monsters they'd conquer the world how did a mad fucker like you live this long i'm good at killing people you don't look much like him what if we prove her wrong bring one of these things who that your father i suppose you favor your mother you knew him 'course i did when he was hand he sent me off hunting for the mountain your wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back thoros has brought me back six times down to king landing and show her the truth we both serve the same lord i serve the north the north didn't raise you from the dead the lord of light never spoke to me i don't know anything about him i don't know what he wants from me he wants you alive why i don't know that all anyone can tell me "i don't know " so what the point in serving a god jon snow: we're all on the same side if none of us knows what he wants i think about that all the time i don't think it our purpose to understand except one thing we're soldiers we have to know what we're fighting for i'm not fighting so some man or woman i barely know can sit on a throne made of swords so what are you fighting for life death is the enemy to prove her loyalty we're all breathin' the first enemy and the last but we all die the enemy always wins and we still need to fight him that all i know you and i won't find much joy while we're here but we can keep others alive we can defend those who can't defend themselves "i am the shield that guards the realms of man " maybe we don't need to understand any more than that ( theme music playing ) maybe that enough aye maybe that enough that what i saw in the fire a mountain like an arrowhead thoros: are you sure we're getting close daenerys: do you know what i like about you i honestly don't you're not a hero oh ( wind howling ) well i've been heroic on occasion i once charged through the mud gate of king landing and i don't want you to be a hero heroes do stupid things and they die drogo jorah daario even this jon snow they all try to outdo each other who can do the stupidest bravest thing it interesting these heroes you name drogo jorah daario you all right mm even this jon snow they all fell in love with you jon snow not in love with me oh my mistake i suppose he stares at you longingly because he hopeful for a successful military alliance he too little for me i didn't mean as heroes go he is quite little i know you're brave i wouldn't have chosen a coward as my hand ever been north before so if all goes well i'll finally get to meet your sister from everything you've told me about her she'd rather murder me than speak with me oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way then she'd murder you nobody trusts my sister less than i do believe me but if we go to the capital we'll go with two armies we'll go with three dragons anyone touches you king landing burns down to the foundation stones never seen snow before and right now she thinking of how to set a trap of course she is and she wondering what trap you're laying for her are we laying any traps if we want to create a new and better world i'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start which war was won without deceit and mass murder yes you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne beautiful eh you need to inspire a degree of fear but fear is all cersei has it all my father had and joffrey it makes their power brittle because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead aegon targaryen got quite a long way on fear he did but you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel aegon built a wheel if that the kind of queen you want to be i can breathe again how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you so we walk into the lions' den my brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the lannister forces forgive me but i don't care about any lannister promises except yours and i promised him i'd keep you from doing anything impulsive impulsive this will be a difficult negotiation down south the air smells like pig shit we're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless my sister is likely to say something provocative and and you have been known to lose your temper from time to time as all great leaders do when have i lost my temper burning the tarlys for instance that was not impulsive that was necessary perhaps perhaps you've never been down south perhaps the father needed to die and not the son perhaps they both needed time to contemplate their mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell we had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities one could be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family side in this debate i am taking their side you need to take your enemy side if you're going to see things the way they do cersei lannister: you must write to lady catelyn i've been to winterfell that the north and you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions respond effectively and beat them which i want you to do very much because i believe in you and in the world you want to build but the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once probably not in a single lifetime how do we ensure that your vision endures after you break the wheel how do we make sure it stays broken ( blows raspberry ) you want to know who sits on the iron throne after i'm dead is that it you say you can't have children but there are other ways of choosing a successor the night watch has one method the ironborn for all their many flaws have another we will discuss the succession after i wear the crown your grace i saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on the blackwater rush and i saw hundreds of arrows miss gendry: how do you live up here but any one of them could have found your heart and ended your you've been thinking about my death quite a bit haven't you is this one of the items you discussed with your brother in king landing i'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term perhaps if you planned for the short term we wouldn't have lost dorne and highgarden we will discuss the succession after i wear the crown ( wind howling ) ( all panting ) how do you keep your balls from freezing off look the hound: a bear big fucker do bears have blue eyes ( grunting ) ( roars ) ( man screaming ) ( distant roaring ) ( roaring ) ( screaming ) ( roaring ) ( shouting grunts ) tormund: you got to keep moving that the secret ( roaring ) ( screaming ) ( roaring ) ( roaring ) ( shouts ) ( grunting ) ( shouting ) ( shouting ) ( roars ) we have to get him back to eastwatch walking good fighting better fucking best flask go on ( skin sizzling ) ( thoros groaning ) ( thoros panting ) you all right i just got bit by a dead bear aye you did funny old life right then we're off there not a living woman within a hundred miles of here where did she get it i don't know she seems very resourceful you're worried we're asking 20 000 man to fight with us in the worst winter any of them have ever seen the weather will be the least of their problems many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home you question their loyalty their loyalty is to jon jon is not here i haven't heard from him in weeks you're the lady of winterfell we have to make do with what we've got the king chose you to rule in his absence and rule you have wisely ably they see that they respect you some may even prefer you yes they turned their backs on jon when it was time to retake winterfell then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again how far would you trust man like that this one is maybe not so smart they're all bloody wind vanes if they found out that i wrote that letter a woman who already married not one but two enemies of her house by the time jon comes back he'll have no army left arya not like them she your sister you may have disagreemants but she would never betray her family she would if she thought i was going to betray jon davos says he a strong fighter is that what she thinks i don't know what she thinks i don't know her anymore perhaps lady brienne could help she sworn to protect both of catelyn stark girls is she not she is and if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede she would if you would help your father urge your brother good that more important than being smart something i've always wanted to know all right how drunk were you when you charged through the breach on pyke if i'm being honest i don't remember charging through the breach some of the lads told me about it the next morning sounded like a good scrap aye it was a proper scrap the ironborn thought you were some kind of god the way you were waving that flaming sword i thought you were the bravest man i ever saw smart people don't come up here looking for the dead just the drunkest ( metal clanking ) where the rest of them if we wait long enough we'll find out ( wind howling ) ( man shouting ) ( choking ) ( panting ) ( wight snarling ) ( snarling continues ) tormund: so you met this dragon queen huh ( snarling screeching ) ( snarling ) ( screeching ) ( screeching stops ) ( distant rumbling ) ( footfalls thundering ) ( screeching ) ( growls ) run back to eastwatch get a raven to daenerys tell her what happened and i'm not leaving you you're the fastest go now you're faster without the hammer give it give it come on run tormund: come on ( cracking ) stop ( ice cracking ) ( wights snarling ) go she'll only fight beside us if i bend the knee ( grunts ) ( panting ) ( panting ) ( panting ) ( snarling ) ( panting ) ( grunts ) ( gate rumbling ) what happened where are the others you spent too much time with the free folk raven we need to send a raven get the maester now ( wight snarling ) ( snarling continues ) ( screeching ) ( wights snarling ) ( snarling continues ) thoros thoros they say it one of the better ways to go beric: lord of light show us the way now you don't like kneeling come to us in our darkness and lead your servant into the light we have to burn his body we'll all be close behind him unless the lord of light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire beric: lord of light come to us in our darkness for the night is dark and full of terrors ( snarling ) we'll all freeze soon and so will the water mance rayder was a brave man when you killed the white walker almost all the dead that followed it fell why maybe he was the one who turned them we can go for the walkers maybe we'll stand a chance jon: no we need to take that thing back with us jon: there a raven flying for dragonstone now daenerys is our only chance no there another a proud man kill him beric: he turned them all you don't understand beric: the lord brought you back he brought me back no one else just us did he do it to watch us freeze to death careful beric you lost your priest this is your last life i've been waiting for the end for a long time the kingbeyondthewall never bent the knee maybe the lord brought me here to find it every lord i've ever met been a cunt don't see why the lord of light should be any different wolkan: my lady my lady it an invitation to king landing my lady you are the lady of winterfell i am and you will represent my interests at this gathering as you see them they invited you they want you there to keep the king peace how many of his people died for his pride i will not set foot in king landing while cersei lannister is queen if they want another stark prisoner they can come and take me until then i'll remain where i belong i have work to do here ( paper thuds ) ( fire crackling ) it not safe ser jaime will be there you said he treated you honorably before you still mad at us boy i'm not worried about me it not safe leaving you with littlefinger i have many guards who would happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here and you trust their loyalty you trust he hasn't been speaking to them all behind your back let me at least leave podrick behind to watch over you he has become a competent swordsman i do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for you sold me to a witch i'm not a child i am the lady of winterfell and i am home this is the safest place for me my lady i swore an oath to protect you and your sister if i abandon you the trip to king landing is long lady brienne and you won't be traveling on summer roads the sooner you leave the better your chances of making it on time yes my lady ( door closes ) a priestess ( dragons snarling ) you can't the most important person in the world can't fly off to the most dangerous place in the world who else can no one they knew the risks when they left you can't win the throne if you're dead you can't break the wheel if you're dead so what would you have me do nothing i'll admit it is a subtle distinction sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do if you die we're all lost everyone everything you told me to do nothing before and i listened to you i'm not doing nothing again ( roaring ) ( grunts ) dumb cunt ( grunts ) oh fuck we're fighting a great war wars cost money fuck it ( shouts ) ( all grunting ) ( snarls ) ( wights snarling ) ( snarling ) ( growls ) ( screeching ) ( screaming ) yah i wanted to be one of you yah ( screaming ) fall back fall back tormund: come on ( grunts ) ( tormund screaming ) help me ( snarling ) ( screaming ) ( shouting ) i wanted to join the brotherhood but you sold me off ( screaming ) ( grunts ) ( drogon screeches ) ( roaring ) ( grunts ) ( wight screeches ) go jon ( shouts ) ( wight snarling ) like a slave ( screaming ) ( roaring ) ( viserion screaming ) ( screaming ) ( roaring ) ( wights snarling ) ( grunting ) ( roaring ) go go now leave ( muffled shouting ) do you know what she did to me ( drogon roars ) ( roaring ) ( shouting ) ( roaring ) ( gasping ) ( grunting ) ( panting ) uncle benjen how you ride for the pass come with me tell him to come to king landing she strapped me down on a bed there no time go ( horse neighs ) ( wights snarling ) ( snarling ) we'll meet again clegane fucking hope not ( drogon screeching ) ( screeching ) ( wind howling ) it time to go your grace she stripped me naked sounds all right so far a bit longer ( screeching ) ( horn blaring ) man: rider approaching man: open the gate ( gate rumbling ) ( seagulls screeching ) ( davos grunts ) ( grunts ) not what you're looking for and put leeches on me was she naked too i have hundreds of man here at winterfell all loyal to me they're not here now what are these my faces where did you get them in braavos while i was training to be a faceless man what does that mean back in braavos before i got my first face there was a game i used to play she needed your blood the game of faces it simple i ask you a question about yourself and you try to make lies sound like the truth if you fool me you win if i catch a lie you lose let play i don't want to play how do you feel about jon being king is there someone else you think should rule the north instead of him yes thank you i know that those faces what are they you want to do the asking are you sure the game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions tell me what they are we both wanted to be other people when we were younger you wanted to be a queen to sit next to a handsome young king on the iron throne i wanted to be a knight could have been worse she wanted to kill me to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle neither of us got to be that other person did we the world doesn't just let girls decide what they're going to be but i can now with the faces i can choose i can become someone else speak in their voice live in their skin i could even become you i wonder what it would feel like they would have killed me if wasn't for davos but they didn't did they to wear those pretty dresses to be the lady of winterfell all i'd need to find out is your face ( gasps ) i'm sorry i'm so sorry i wish i could take it back i wish we'd never gone i don't so what you whinging about if we hadn't gone i wouldn't have seen you have to see it to know now i know the dragons are my children they're the only children i'll ever have do you understand we are going to destroy the night king and his army and we'll do it together you have my word thank you dany i'm not whinging "dany" ( chuckles ) who was the last person who called me that i'm not sure was it my brother mm not the company you want to keep all right not "dany " how about "my queen" i'd uh bend the knee but what about those who swore allegiance to you your lips are moving and you're complaining about something they'll all come to see you for what you are i hope i deserve it you do you should get some rest ( sighs ) ( wind howling ) ( music playing ) and swear his fealty to joffrey that whinging this one been killed six times you don't hear him bitching about it good lad jon: the first time i went north of the wall was with your father he was a good man he deserved a better son were you with him at the end i was a prisoner of the wildlings but we avenged him you're sure this is the only copy in winterfell i want you to know that every mutineer found justice can't think of a worse way for him to go the night watch was his life he would have died to protect every one of those man and they butchered him i hate that he died that way my father was the most honorable man i ever met he was good all the way through and he died on the executioner block 0 game of thrones s07e07 the dragon and the wolf srt (groans) sansa stark: she would if she thought i was going to betray jon i was only trying to protect her you and me both she alive arya where winterfell who protecting her if you're here the only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way it won't be me tyrion: here we are with the faces i can become someone else the heroes of blackwater bay strange place for a reunion it is my lord i don't think i'm anyone lord anymore podrick save the titles for ser bronn of the blackwater i'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne you've been thinking about our new queen perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances remember my offer i wonder what it would feel like to be the lady of winterfell whatever they're paying you i'll pay double and that would be double what now exactly don't you worry about me i'm doing all right looking after myself tyrion: are you helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself was it you put yourself at risk i put yourself at risk important difference it your head queen cersei offered a bag of gold for it not mine now thanks to me all i'd need to find out is your face she got two traitors' heads coming right through her door she can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes all thanks to ser bronn of the fucking blackwater if that not looking after myself i don't know what is it good to see you again yeah you too anyone touches it i'll kill you first come on pod let you and me go have a drink daenerys will win this war while the fancy folks talk eh i left this shit city because i didn't want to die in it am i going to die in this shit city you might and this is all your idea seems every bad idea has some lannister cunt behind it and some clegane cunt to help them see it through ( footsteps approach ) remember me if you want cersei to bend the knee yeah you do you're even fucking uglier than i am now what did they do to you doesn't matter that not how it ends for you brother you know who coming for you you've always known where is she she'll be here soon didn't travel with you you can ask her yourself no ( dragons screeching ) ( screeching ) ( wings flapping ) ( roaring ) ( roaring ) we've been here for some time my apologies we are all facing a unique euron: theon i have your sister she has a more important request if you don't submit to me here now i'll kill her i think we ought to begin with larger concerns then why are you talking you're the smallest concern here do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes his wasn't even good he explained it at the end never explain it always ruins it we don't even let your kind live cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing in the iron islands you know we kill you at birth an act of mercy for the parents perhaps you ought to sit down why sit down or leave ( laughing ) we are a group of people who do not like one another as this recent demonstration has shown we have suffered at each other hands but a story what if we prove her wrong we have lost people we love at each other hands if all we wanted was more of the same there would be no need for this gathering we are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting facetoface so instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days we all know that will never happen then why are we here this isn't about living in harmony little theon come and get her bring the dead to her it just about living the same thing is coming for all of us a general you can't negotiate with an army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield lord tyrion tells me a million people live in this city they're about to become a million more soldiers in the army of the dead i imagine for most of them it would be an improvemant this is serious i wouldn't be here if it weren't i don't think it serious at all (walker shrieking) i think it another bad joke if my brother jaime has informed me correctly you're asking me for a truce yes that all that all pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt or while you solidify and expand your position hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the man go your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with you have my word the word of a wouldbe usurper there is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years we have something to show you ( chains rattling ) ( box thuds ) ( screeching ) ( grunts ) we are going to destroy the night king and his army ( screeching ) we can destroy them by burning them ( screeching ) and we can destroy them with dragonglass if we don't win this fight then that is the fate of every person in the world ( grunts ) there is only one war that matters the great war and it is here thank you my queen daenerys: i didn't believe it until i saw them i saw them all how many a hundred thousand at least can they swim no good i'm taking the iron fleet back to the iron islands what are you talking about i've been around the world ( theme song playing ) i've seen everything things you couldn't imagine and this this is the only thing i've ever seen that terrifies me i'm going back to my island you should go back to yours when winter over we'll be the only ones left alive cersei: he right to be afraid and a coward to run if those things come for us ( chatter ) there will be no kingdoms to rule everything we suffered will have been for nothing everything we lost will have been for nothing the crown accepts your truce until the dead are defeated they are the true enemy ( sighs ) in return the king in the north will extend this truce he will remain in the north where he belongs he will not take up arms against the lannisters he will not choose sides ( chatter continues ) daenerys: just the king in the north not me ( cersei chuckles ) i would never ask it of you you would never agree to it and if you did i would trust you even less than i do now i ask it only of ned stark son i know ned stark son will be true to his word i am true to my word or i try to be that is why i cannot give you what you ask bronn: oil pitch my lord i cannot serve two queens and i have already pledged myself to queen daenerys of house targaryen then there is nothing left to discuss the dead will come north first enjoy dealing with them we will deal with whatever is left of you brienne: ser jaime it been good to see you i imagine the next time will be across a battlefield we both saw what just happened how many barrels 500 my lord we both saw that thing yes and i'm not looking forward to seeing more of them but i'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to sansa and her dolt brother oh fuck loyalty fuck loyalty this goes beyond houses and honor and oaths talk to the queen and tell her what davos: i wish you hadn't done that (cackles manically) get 500 more i'm grateful for your loyalty but my dragon died so that we could be here if it all for nothing then he died for nothing i know i'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen i would have advised it had you asked but have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then just a bit yes my lord i'm not going to swear an oath i can't uphold talk about my father if you want tell me that the attitude that got him killed but when enough people make false promises words stop meaning anything then there are no more answers only better and better lies and lies won't help us in this fight tyrion: that is indeed a problem the more immediate problem is that we're fucked any ideas as to how we might i still enjoy it when they call me "my lord " change that state of affairs only one everyone stays here and i go and talk to my sister i didn't come all this way to have my hand murdered i don't want cersei to murder me either i could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble jon: i did this i should go she'll definitely murder you i go see my sister alone the thrill will fade or we all go home and we're right back where we started you spoke with her at her until she kicked me out she thinks i was an idiot to trust you a lot of people seem to think that actually i'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who already tried to kill me twice that i know of who an idiot i suppose we should say goodbye if we live that long one idiot to another i shouldn't be surprised i suppose she your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place a foreign whore you can't abduct beat or intimidate that must be difficult for you so you bring her here with her pet northerner whom you've convinced to bow down before her i didn't know about that and now you've got them both working towards the same goal the goal you've worked towards your entire life man without cocks cersei i didn't know the destruction of this family i am the one preventing that from happening daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate she didn't want to bring you words she wanted to bring you fire and blood until i advised her otherwise i don't want to destroy our family i never have you killed our father after he sentenced me to death you wouldn't find me fighting in an army for a crime i didn't commit yes i killed him hate me for it if you want i hate myself for it in spite of what he was in spite of what he did to me oh poor little man your papa was mean to you do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow you left us open you laid us bare for the vultures and the vultures came and tore us apart if i had no cock you may not have killed joffrey but you killed myrcella you killed tomman no one would've touched them if father was here no one would have dared i have never been more sorry about anything i will not hear it not from you i will not hear it all right you love your family and i have destroyed it i will always be a threat what left to fight for so put an end to me if it weren't for me you'd have a mother if it weren't for me you'd have a father if it weren't for me you'd have two beautiful children i've thought about killing you more times than i can count do it say the word ( sighs ) ( pants ) gold i am more sorry about the children than you could ever know i will not i don't care i loved them you know i did you know it in your heart if there anything left of it it doesn't matter your love doesn't matter your feelings don't matter i don't care why you did what you did i only care what it cost us it cost us our future if there no future then why are we here it an invitation to king landing i spent my life around soldiers why did you allow me to come not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction yes no not what you hoped for but you must have hoped for something what did you hope for to make jon snow submit to your queen mm not like this but eventually you want everyone to bend the knee to her yes why because i think she will make the world a better place what do you think they spend that gold on you said she'd destroy king landing she knows herself she chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them that the difference between you i don't care about checking my worst impulses i don't care about making the world a better place hang the world that thing you dragged here i know what it is i know what it means family and when it came at me i didn't think about the world not at all as soon as it opened its mouth the world disappeared for me right down its black throat all i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most away from my family maybe euron greyjoy had the right idea get on a boat take those who matter not without a cock you don't you're pregt ( sighs ) no one is less happy about this than i am i know i respect what you did wish you hadn't done it but i respect it this place was the beginning of the end for my family ( speaking valyrian ) a dragon is not a slave they were terrifying maybe it really is all cocks in the end extraordinary they filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here they wasted away they grew small and we grew small as well we weren't extraordinary without them we were just like everyone else you're not like everyone else and your family hasn't seen its end yet your brother has chosen to side with the cockless you're still here i can't have children who told you that the witch who murdered my husband has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information you were right from the beginning if i had trusted you everything would be different so what now i can't forget what i saw north of the wall yes he always been a champion of the downtrodden and i can't pretend that cersei won't take back half the country the momant i march north it appears tyrion assessmant was correct we're fucked ( footsteps approaching ) ( footsteps approaching ) my armies will not stand down i will not pull them back to the capital i will march them north to fight alongside you in the great war the darkness is coming for us all ( trumpet blares ) we'll face it together and when the great war is over perhaps you'll remember i chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you i expect not call our banners all of them ( wind howling ) ( cawing ) littlefinger: it not easy for ravens to fly in these storms perhaps jon tried to send word earlier ( distant man shrieking ) ( hoofbeats thundering ) no this is the way he is the way he always been he never asked for my opinion why would he start now i can't believe he'd surrender the northern crown without consulting you this is his writing his signature he pledged to fight for daenerys targaryen he bent the knee i've heard gossip that the dragon queen is quite beautiful what does that have to do with anything ( shrieking continues ) jon is young and unmarried daenerys is young and unmarried you think he wants to marry her an alliance makes sense together they'd be difficult to defeat he was named king in the north he can be unnamed even if i wanted to arya would never go along she always loved jon far more than she ever loved me and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family you will represent my interests i think we're about to be the downtrodden you are family too would arya really murder her own sister do you know what she is now do you know what the faceless man are only by reputation they worship the god of death i believe i never trust godly man they're killers and arya was one of them what do you think she after man: archers stand tall she your sister you know her far better than i ever could sometimes when i try to understand a person motives i play a little game i assume the worst what the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do then i ask myself "how well does that reason explain what they say and what they do" ( horses neighing ) man ♪2: cover that wall so tell me what the worst thing she could want she could want me dead because she thinks i wronged my family why did she come to winterfell to kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family why did she unearth the letter cersei made you write to provide proof of my betrayals to provide justification after she murders me ( seagulls screeching ) and after she murders you what does she become lady of winterfell ( waves crashing ) if we have the dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad they'll arrive at winterfell within the fortnight and the unsullied we can sail with them to white harbor meet the dothraki here on the kingsroad then ride together to winterfell how many people live here a million give or take perhaps you should fly to winterfell your grace you have many enemies in the north thousands fell fighting your father all it takes is one angry man with a crossbow he'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one wellplaced bolt will make him a hero the man who killed the conqueror jon: it your decision your grace but if we're going to be allies in this war it important for the northerners to see us as allies that more people than the entire north crammed into that if we sail to white harbor together i think it sends a better message i've not come to conquer the north i'm coming to save the north we sail together jon can i speak with you all right what you did in king landing what you said why would anyone want to live that way you could've lied to cersei about bending the knee to daenerys you risked everything to tell an enemy the truth we went down there to make peace and it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together you've always known what was right even when we were all young and stupid you always knew every step you take there more work in the city it always the right step it not it may seem that way from the outside but i promise you it not true i've done plenty of things that i regret not compared to me you haven't no not compared to you i always wanted to do the right thing be the right kind of person and the brothels are far superior but i never knew what that meant it always seemed like there like there was an impossible choice i had to make stark or greyjoy our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was he was and you betrayed him betrayed his memory i did ( sighs ) but you never lost him ( wight screeching ) he a part of you just like he a part of me but the things i've done it not my place to forgive you for all of it but what i can forgive i do you don't need to choose you're a greyjoy and you're a stark when i was ramsay prisoner at this gathering as you see them ( seagulls screeching ) yara tried to save me she the only one who tried to save me ( sniffles ) she needs me now so why are you still talking to me harrag: load up load up lads go on ( chatter ) tide coming in all of us chose to follow yara cersei: why isn't she with them we left the iron islands for yara she would never leave one of us behind we're not leaving her behind your sister dead she not dead she dead even if euron hasn't cut her throat yet she dead she our queen she your sister and you left her to die i did i ran from my uncle i was a coward qyburn: i'm afraid i don't know your grace so why in fuck name should we listen to you they say the dead can't swim we're going to sail east find a nice quiet island kill all the man and take their wives for ourselves we're done with all that who says we are yara did she made a pledge we're going to find her and we're going to set her free ( spits ) ( man laugh ) no one has seen her run away little theon it what you do best man: he needs to shut his mouth ( man cheering ) man: hey ( man laughing ) ( shouts ) man ♪2: oh yes man ♪3: that more like it ( man laughing ) ( grunts ) stay down or i'll kill you and the rest of them ( grunts ) i said stay down or i'll kill you ( shouting ) ( grunting ) ( grunts ) ( shouts ) ( grunting ) ( pants ) not for me for yara they're on their way to the dragonpit now man: yara have my sister brought to the great hall are you sure you want to do this it not what i want it what honor demands and what does honor demand that i defend my family from those who would harm us that i defend the north from those who would betray us all right then get on with it you stand accused of murder including our brother you stand accused of treason how do you answer these charges lord baelish my sister asked you a question lady sansa forgive me i'm a bit confused which charges confuse you let start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt lysa arryn you pushed her through the moon door and watched her fall yes your grace do you deny it i did it to protect you you did it to take power in the vale earlier you conspired to murder jon arryn you gave lysa tears of lys to poison him do you deny it whatever your aunt might have told you she was a troubled woman she imagined enemies everywhere you had aunt lysa send a letter to our parents if anything goes wrong telling them it was the lannisters who murdered jon arryn when really it was you the conflict between the starks and the lannisters it was you who started it do you deny it i know of no such letter you conspired with cersei lannister and joffrey baratheon to betray our father ned stark thanks to your treachery he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason kill the silverhaired bitch first do you deny it i deny it none of you were there to see what happened none of you knows the truth you held a knife to his throat you said "i did warn you not the trust me " you told our mother this knife belonged to tyrion lannister but that was another one of your lies it was yours lady sansa i have known you since you were a girl i've protected you protected me it not safe leaving you with littlefinger then our brother then the bastard who calls himself king by selling me to the boltons if we could speak alone i can explain everything sometimes when i'm trying to understand a person motives i play a little game i assume the worst what the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister that what you do isn't it that what you've always done the rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit turn family against family turn sister against sister that what you did to our mother and aunt lysa and that what you tried to do to us sansa please i'm a slow learner it true but i learn give me a chance to defend myself i deserve that i am lord protector of the vale come ser gregor and i command you to escort me safely back to the eyrie i think not sansa i beg you i loved your mother since the time i was a boy and yet you betrayed her i loved you more than anyone and yet you betrayed me when you brought me back to winterfell you told me there no justice in the world it time for us to meet our guests not unless we make it thank you for all your many lessons lord baelish i will never forget them sansa ( gasps ) i jaime: our man in king landing will march north in three days' time man: it'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train ( donkey braying ) jaime: we don't have a fortnight if the north falls we fall three days the remaining forces in the westerlands will take the river road east we'll meet at lord harroway town and march together to winterfell ser jaime your grace my lords i need a momant with my brother man: your grace missandei: why did they build it what are you doing preparing the expedition north expedition north i always knew you were the stupidest lannister the starks and targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them are you a traitor or an idiot you pledged our forces to fight our common enemy i'll say whatever i need to say to ensure the survival of our house you expect me to trust the man who murdered our father dragons don't understand the difference you expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum to fight for the dragon queen you saw it with your own eyes you saw a dead man trying to kill us i saw it burn if dragons can't stop them if dothraki and unsullied and northman can't stop them how will our armies make a difference this isn't about noble houses this is about the living and the dead between what is theirs and what isn't and i intend to stay amongst the living let the stark boy and his new queen defend the north we stay here where we've always been i made a promise our child will rule westeros our child will never be born if the dead come south the monsters are real the white walkers the dragons the dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young they're all real land livestock children so be it let the monsters kill each other and while they battle in the north we take back the lands that belong to us and then what and then we rule when the fighting in the north is over someone wins you understand that don't you if the dead win they march south and kill us all if the living win and we've betrayed them they march south and kill us all letting them roam free around a city was a problem the targaryens and the starks already want to kill us all most of them will die in the north i faced them in the field we can't beat them we can't beat their dragons how many dragons did you see at the pit two what happened to the third for all we know it guarding her fleet she came here with her dragons and her dothraki and her unsullied she came here to show us all her power no something happened the dragons are vulnerable littlefinger: she your sister i imagine it was a sad joke at the end we can't beat the dothraki we don't have the numbers we don't have the support of the other houses no we have something better we have the iron bank you should've listened more when father spoke about the importance of gold oh i know it boring for you you just wanted to hunt and ride and fight but i listened i learned highgarden bought us the most powerful army in essos the golden company 20 000 man horses elephants i believe an entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs the golden company is not here they're in essos how is a mercenary company in essos going to help us do you really think euron greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the iron islands do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen no one walks away from me he sailing with his fleet to essos he going to ferry the golden company back here but in the beginning when it was home to balerion the dread to help us win the war for westeros you plotted with euron greyjoy without telling me the commander of your armies and you conspired with tyrion the man who murdered our father without telling me your queen i didn't conspire with him you met with him in secret without my consent you planned to promote my enemies' interests that is the definition of conspiracy it must have been the most dangerous place in the world i pledged to ride north i intend to honor that pledge and that will be treason treason disobeying your queen command fighting with her enemies what would you call it doesn't matter what i'd call it i told you no one walks away from me are you going to order him to kill me i'm the only one you have left our
