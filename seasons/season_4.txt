people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike but i can see his arms beginning to shake what the prize to winning this stupid contest the honour of riding by your side on the road to meereen that honour goes to ser jorah and ser barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning you two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock the last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for you like this girl must be frustrating you are not a smart man daario naharis other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner i'd rather have no brains and two balls you need to eat something pigeon pie no thank you lemon cakes no thank you you love lemon cakes tell her she needs to eat my lady you do need to eat they will continue to do so when you go home

they sewed his direwolf head onto his body and my mother they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river what happened to your family was a terrible crime i didn't know your brother he seemed like a good man but i didn't know him your mother i admired her you'll return to casterly rock and rule in my stead she wanted to have me executed but i admired her she was a strong woman and she was fierce when it came to protecting her children sansa your mother would want you to carry on you know it true will you pardon me my lord i'd like to visit the godswood of course prayer can be helpful i hear i don't pray any more it the only place i can go where people don't talk to me you are the lord of casterly rock my lion what are you doing what does it look like come here how many times have i told you you can't visit me here i know we have come to a dangerous place have you forgotten me do you know how long it been of course i haven't forgotten i want you don't you want me i

diamonds and make me disappear what are you talking about if you want me to leave just say it say it shh you know what they call me i don't know what you're talking about you want me to stay a work of art the craftsmanship is excellent you like it so much you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it you're such an ingrate i spent days with the goldsmith getting the details just right days better part of an afternoon there how does that feel kingslayer oathbreaker man without honour uh a hook would be more practical elegant i think cersel: thank you for your help with the other matter the symptoms have abated gone completely i am in your debt maester qyburn not a maester your grace but happy to help whenever i can odd little man i've grown fond of him he quite talented what symptoms now you want me to break another sacred vow symptoms that are not your concern you let him touch you you jealous i'm surprised you never let pycelle near you you think i'd let that old lecher put his hands on me he smells like a dead cat i'm not sure i've ever smelled a dead cat well they smell like pycelle you drink more than you used to you won't be breaking anything yes why hmm let see you started a brawl in the streets with ned stark and disappeared from the capital my husband died in a tragic hunting accident it must have been traumatic for you my only daughter was shipped off to dorne we suffered through a siege a rather short siege that i didn't expect to survive and now i'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from highgarden there is a precedent to relieve a kingsguard of his duties while i'm supposed to marry her brother a renowned pillowbiter so father disowned me today he can't disown you you're all he got you're forgetting tyrion you don't really plan on staying in the kingsguard do you staying in the kingsguard means i live right here in the red keep with you not now i want not now when i've been back for weeks something changed everything changed you come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand the king will exercise that prerogative and expect everything to be the same what do you want me to apologise for for leaving me you think i wanted to be taken prisoner don't know what you wanted you weren't here you left me alone every day i was a prisoner i plotted my escape every day i murdered people so i could be here with you you took too long i no what are you saying you took too long come in go away forgive me your grace you told me to come at once if there was anything important you plan on killing all the crows yourself do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter we wait for mance orders you sent a man over the wall at the full moon if he not back yet he not coming back and what is it you want no march on castle black with just this lot your pretty crow said a thousand man are nesting there he a liar he is shouldn't it be "he was" you said you put three arrows in him i did i've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit eye at 200 yards if that boy still walking it 'cause you let him go no thenns i fucking hate thenns mance sent you how did you find us you came from the south not the north took a detour got some supper from a village down that way why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the wall help yourself no one made a valyrian steel sword since the doom of valyria i don't believe i asked you a question there my answer maybe everything just better fed down here fat and lazy easier for us you didn't see us coming lost your warg and that baby crow you had with you lost him too i'll answer to mance i won't answer to you she yours if you think your bloody honour comes before your i'm not anybody too scrawny not like those crows at castle black think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew getting nice and fat and marbled i know we've had our differences tormund but just one time before you die you really ought to try crow draw my bloody honour is beyond repair but my answer is still no loose last time i saw him he was in the courtyard at winterfell he said "next time i see you you'll be all in black " i was jealous of robb my whole life the way my father looked at him i wanted that he was better than me at everything fighting and hunting and riding and girls gods the girls loved him i don't want casterly rock a wife children i wanted to hate him but i never could sometimes i want to hate you you're better than me at everything except reading they're um they're ready for you he wanted to hang me for a while now his chance no one going to hang you you've done nothing wrong i've done plenty wrong so you admit you murdered qhorin halfhand what do you want i didn't murder him no you put your sword through a brother of the night watch what do you call that he wanted me to kill him a bastard son of a traitor what would you expect the halfhand believed our only chance to stop mance was to get a man inside his army don't talk about the halfhand as if you knew him he was my brother then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the wall the free folk would have boiled him alive but letting me kill him the free folk listen to him supper would be nice he even talks like a wildling now aye i talk like a wildling i ate with the wildlings i climbed the wall with the wildlings i i laid with a wildling girl you admit to breaking your vows then i do the law is the law the boy must die if we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl the wall would be manned by headless man for 40 years i've tried to teach you there a difference between sneaking off to the mole town brothel and sleeping with the enemy while we sit here debating which rules i broke mance rayder marches on the wall with an army of 100 000 impossible you can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other 100 000 he united the thenns the hornfoots the iceriver clans he has giants fighting for him giants if you haven't learned by now you never will have you ever been beyond the wall ser i commanded the city watch of king landing boy and now you're here you must not have been very good at your job how dare you there a band of wildlings south of the wall already led by tormund giantsbane i killed their warg and three others they shot me full of arrows their orders are to attack castle black from the south when mance hits it from the north the signal for the attack will be a bonfire go mance said it would be the greatest fire the north has ever seen that the truth all the truth do you intend to execute me or am i free to go none of us are free we are man of the night watch but we won't be taking your head today jon snow go on i am acting commander here maester aemon yes you are if serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition go serve and i don't trust the bastard he told the truth and you always know when a man telling a lie how did you acquire this magical power i grew up in king landing no you're a queen not an ox your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday the wedding is in a fortnight grandmother you can't say no to everything there are three living smiths who know how to rework valyrian steel i suppose you want the sword back nonsense my little dears go and speak to the jewellers of king landing tell them who you are who sent you the one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best the margaery tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire a thousand songs how sad it will be if she wearing rubbish like that perhaps i should just let joffrey choose it for me end up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck you watch that even here with me keep it my word my lady please pardon me for interrupting my name is brienne of tarth we know who you are we've heard all about you but hearing is one thing aren't you just marvellous absolutely singular i hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is my lady i know this is a very busy time for you but if i could just have a momant a onehanded man with no family needs all the help he can get you dare not refuse a shadow with the face of stannis baratheon i swear to you by all the gods it was stannis he plunged his sword through renly heart and disappeared one day i will avenge our king joffrey is our king now i meant no offence and you've given none all the kingsguard will be on duty ser boros will be stationed here how many dornishman does

grace i was rather busy busy getting captured so this is the famous book of brothers all the great deeds of all the great kingsguard ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning led the attack on the kingswood brotherhood seems to me the smart place to meet travellers is in a tavern defeated the smiling knight in single combat ser duncan the tall four pages he must have been quite a man so they say ser jaime lannister hmm someone forgot to write down all your great deeds there still time is there for a 40yearold knight with one hand how can you protect me with that that way one party is late the other party can drink some ale inside i use my left hand now your grace makes for more of a contest have you ever been to meereen several times your grace with master kraznys and they say a thousand slaves died building the great pyramid of meereen and now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates you think the great masters are worried if they're smart your grace you were told to ride at the back of the train this is the prince of dorne we're waiting for not one of your sellsword friends yes my queen but i need to speak to you about something important a matter of strategy your grace all right what is this matter of strategy a dusk rose would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding and this one called lady lace would you like to walk without shoes you have to know a land to rule it if he so damned important how come they sent you to meet him its plants its rivers its roads its people dusk rose tea eases fever everyone in meereen knows that

here look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in king landing are you sure we're not related ever since i've returned every lannister i've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass

i'm paying my share shall we stick golden roses on half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity no your heartfelt "thank you" is its own reward i would imagine i'll be hearing it again before

about the iron bank we both know you're smarter than that come tywin let us celebrate young love all taken care of you saw her board the ship aye she on it and you saw the ship sail away no one knows

beautiful what about your left as does yours so are you looking forward to your wedding yes very much our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect they certainly are perhaps they should get married if you were to marry cersei she'd murder you in your sleep if you somehow managed to put a child in her first she'd murder him too long before he drew his first breath luckily for you none of this will happen because you'll never marry her and neither will you i can hold a sword but all my instincts are wrong your grace my king my queen lady brienne so good of you to come i'm no lady your grace cersel: did you just bow apologies your grace i never did master the curtsy you're the one who put a sword through renly baratheon that not true my love brienne had nothing to do with it a shame

time and he will be able to walk again they call it the rich man disease a wonder you don't have it nobleman in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in dorne learn

field of battle i speak as a firsthand witness climb down from the high table with your new valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne be careful though unusual talent for a sellsword this one is clearly mad with lust it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night a fine vintage shame that it spilled it did not spill my love come back

man mind yourself lf i still had my right hand plan on growing it back come on then open the gates riders coming in lf you make it out of the woods you win let get these horses seen to father welcome home walda this is ramsay snow my bastard a pleasure mother hello see that the horses are fed watered and rubbed down and take lady walda to her chambers this way my lady where is your prize with the hounds run tansy i'll have a look at him i hear you took a hand from the kingslayer word travels how he screamed you would have loved it father what did you do to him i trained him he was a slow learner but he learned you flayed him peeled a few bits removed a few others 0 game of thrones s04e03 breaker of chains srt you did this you'll be fine he built this sept he also named a 6yearold boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles he ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful hmm justice mmm a good king must be just orys i was just everyone applauded his reforms you're stronger than you know nobles and commoners alike but he wasn't just for long he was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother was that truly just of him to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognise no no what about strength yes strength king robert was strong he won the rebellion lord baelish petyr and crushed the targaryen dynasty and he attended three small council meetings in 17 years he spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him so we have a man who starves himself to death a man who lets his own brother murder him and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing what do they all lack wisdom yes wisdom is what makes a good king yes are you hurt my lady but what is wisdom hmm a house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you how do you know which choice is wise and which isn't you've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers no of course not a wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't you're young a wise young king listens to his counsellors and heeds their advice until he comes of age good and the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards your brother was not a wise king your brother was not a good king if he had been perhaps he'd still be alive now as the king you will have to marry do you understand why a king needs a queen yes but why i'm sure you've had quite a fright rest easy to further the family line do you know how that happens yes but has anyone explained the details to you i don't think so it all relatively straightforward how are you i'm all right you are you will be i'll see to that please give the queen a momant alone with her son yes my lord all of you the worst is past lord baelish it was tyrion he killed him he told me he would "a day will come when you think you are safe and happy "and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth " that what he said to me you saw it you saw joff point at him just before he i don't know what i saw avenge him avenge our son i promised i'd get her to you safely softly my friend kill tyrion tyrion my brother our brother there'll be a trial we'll get to the truth of what happened i don't want a trial he'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance i want him dead please jaime you have to he was our son our baby boy voices carry over water you're a hateful woman why have the gods made me love a hateful woman jaime not here please please stop it stop it no stop it stop stop it not right it not right i should get back before someone thinks to look for me i don't care don't i don't care jaime don't i don't care gonna rain soon where are we near fairmarket i think you think you don't have a map no maybe we should get one just point out the next map shop you see and i'll buy you one we have

it we ask the father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty we ask the mother to bless our crops shh so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door we ask the warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil we ask the maiden to protect sally virtue and keep her from the clutches of depravity you going to do all seven of the fuckers father we ask the smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us we ask the crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness and we ask the stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all you don't want the queen to hear do you i'm so sorry really good did you fight at the twins call that a fight slaughtering livestock more like the red wedding they're calling it walder frey committed sacrilege that day he shared bread and salt with the starks he offered them guest right guest right don't mean much any more it means something to me the gods will have their vengeance a thousand gold cloaks are searching for you frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did things were different when hoster tully ruled the riverlands we had good years and bad years same as anyone but we were safe now with the freys raiders come plundering steal our food steal our silver i was gonna send sally north to stay with my brother but the north no better the whole country gone sour you got any ale afraid not how can a man not keep ale in his home and if they found you you look like you could really swing that sword a real warrior with proper training those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you how would it be if you stayed on till the new moon i could use a man to help with the farm work sally does what she can but she can't lift a bale of hay and if any thieves came looking for easy pickings one look at you i bet they'd run the other way meaning no offence how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king what'll you

if that what you mean i worry about it sometimes all the time why do you worry about it one hundred man one woman they've got other things to think about and you fled the scene of his murder that the only thing they think about you're being silly i'm not being silly there 100 man lying awake at night picturing you what about you what about me gilly i worry about you thank you for what for worrying

sam your grace you're a literary man now what do you make of that joffrey "the usurper joffrey baratheon " i said those words when i tossed a leech into the fire filled with bastard blood a bastard you set free i am now faced with a great opportunity and i don't trust drunk fools and i am powerless to take advantage of it i will find you an army your grace i've been working day and night what progress have you made i've rallied house peasebury to your cause house peasebury house musgood house musgood and house haigh house haigh they don't have enough man between them to raid a pantry westeros is not the world your grace we need to look east for ships and man 10 000 skilled soldiers fight for the golden company he saved me the golden company they've never broken a contract they're sellswords we're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne but we're not willing to pay man to fight now the red woman magic is real her visions and prophecies may be too but i've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war soldiers win wars soldiers on the ground it dirty on the ground we don't have any gold saved you my lady he followed my orders every one of them not yet if i do not press my claim my claim will be forgotten i will not become a page in someone else history book i'm running out of time ser davos which means you're running out of time you're late i'm sorry princess i thought you weren't coming the hand of the king doesn't have much leisure time you won't be a very good hand if you see the word knight and say "kanigit " and he did it all for gold that happened once weeks ago you're your father daughter no mistake bloody relentless the both of you it a new one today lots of tricky words but i think you can manage you'll never read well if you move your lips that how children do it "the life and adventures of elyo grivas "first sword of braavos " thank you very much money buys a man silence for a time i like this one it full of swordfights and pirates you were a pirate once no i was a smuggler what the difference if you're a famous smuggler you're not doing it right my father says a criminal is a criminal your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behaviour so do the braavosi you've sailed to braavos of course almost got beheaded by a first sword of braavos i tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers where sansa a bolt in the heart buys it forever but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father i suppose if you work for the iron bank of braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction what was that for i need you to write a message you should write it yourself it good practice it too important for me i need a smart person to do it go on to the offices of the iron bank of braavos from stannis baratheon the one true king of westeros he was helping me because i saved his life but that not you i need to get their attention go write he seen some adventures hasn't he precious little thing thank you what his name sam lovely that the daddy no where the daddy he dead yes and he gave you a priceless necklace where you from north of here north of here you a fucking wildling only room and board that right she'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies could find other work for her too no other work there'd be money give you a piece of it no other work that once belonged to his grandmother i promise to come back and visit whenever i can

can't run away which is what we did at craster you have to trust me it for the best best for you the last legacy of house hollard oh gilly please don't greedy no i'm sorry you're lovely i just never acquired the taste you're calling my beauty an acquired taste that quite all right lover there more for you your loss you like them both the same boys and girls does that surprise you everyone has a preference i had it made a few weeks ago then everyone is missing half the world pleasure the gods made that and it delights me the gods made this and it delights me when it comes to war i fight for dorne when it comes to love i don't choose sides i hope i have as much stamina when i'm your age what are you 25 children someday if you're lucky you will wake up and realise you are old what did i once tell you about the capital that pretty ass of yours will sag your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and grey hairs will sprout from your ears no one will want you any more make sure you've fucked your fill before that day did you he is a prince of dorne girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies they will all have to line up behind you prince oberyn lord tywin "we're all liars here " may we have the room call my name if you need me lover would you like to sit no thank you some wine no thank you i'm sorry about your grandson are you i don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father or his grandfather an awful way to die come my lady which way is that are you interrogating me lord tywin some believe the king choked some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant the king was poisoned i hear you studied poisons at the citadel i did this is why i know your hatred for my family is rather wellknown you arrive at the capital an expert in poisoning some days later my grandson dies of poisoning i know you've had a difficult day rather suspicious why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon you spoke with tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived what did you discuss you think we conspired together what did you discuss the death of my sister for which you blame me she was raped and murdered by the mountain the mountain follows your orders of course i blame you find her bar the gates of the city seize every ship in the harbour but you're safe now here i stand unarmed unguarded should i be concerned you are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that i am a man of reason if i cut your throat today i will be drawn and quartered tomorrow man at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge so you deny involvemant in elia murder categorically i would like to speak with the mountain i'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you i promise you that he might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would i could arrange for this meeting but you want something in return there will be a trial for my son and as custom dictates three judges will render a verdict i will preside mace tyrell will serve as the second judge i would like you to be the third why not long ago the tyrells sided with renly baratheon you're safe with me declared themselves enemies of the throne now they are our strongest allies well you made the tyrell girl a queen asking me to judge at your son trial isn't quite as tempting i would also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king principal advisors i never realised you had such respect for dorne lord tywin we are not the seven kingdoms until dorne returns to the fold the king is dead the greyjoys are in open rebellion a wildling army marches on the wall sailing home and in the east a targaryen girl has three dragons before long she will turn her eyes to westeros only the dornish managed to resist aegon targaryen and his dragons you're saying you need us that must be hard for you to admit we need each other you help me serve justice to the king assassins and i will help you serve justice to elia podrick apologies for the stench so am i the queen i brought you some wine my lord but they took it from me a noble effort they didn't find the candles though a quill some parchmant duck sausage almonds and some hard cheese you're a good lad any word of shae i've heard nothing my lord i suppose that a good thing more than you were with renly what are they saying about me out there you're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king do you believe i murdered joffrey no my lord you didn't gods no the world is a better place without him but i had nothing to do with it i would like to think if i were arranging a royal assassination i'd plan it in such a way that i wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died trial in a fortnight less than you would have been have they announced the judges yet your father of course mace tyrell who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote and prince oberyn of dorne oberyn give it to my father he never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy i'm supposed to get a list of names from you my lord anyone who might testify on your behalf oh i can call my own witnesses if joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying how generous of them very well my wife sansa my lord she gone gone no one seen her since the wedding you don't think she no one had more cause to kill joffrey than sansa but the girl is no assassin whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it and with my wife disappearance it makes me seem that much more guilty podrick yes my lord this would not be an opportune momant to press the issue they'll be following you now who will i don't know they the ominous they the man pulling the strings or woman my father maybe joffrey was too much work for him sweet tomman will be so much easier to handle whenever something bad happens to me i assume it my sister that had a hand in it but say what you will of cersei she loves her children she is the only one i'm certain had nothing to do with this murder which makes it unique as king landing murders go clawing at his own throat looking to his mother to make it stop any other witnesses my lord varys could vouch for me if he dared he already been called as a witness for the queen of course fetch bronn i have a job for him i've already asked my lord they won't let him see you why not they say he a known cutthroat and your close associate he under investigation himself and my brother will they at least allow me to see jaime i'll ask my lord where is she no one leaves the capital it was horrible there something else my lord a man i didn't know his face he came to ask if i'd testify against you said i'd be named ser podrick payne if i told the judges you'd bought a poison called the strangler ser podrick payne has a nice ring to it what did you tell him i didn't tell them anything my lord are you going to accept their offer my lord testifying against me wasn't a suggestion if they can't tempt you with honey they'll choose something less sweet the world is overflowing with horrible things you've been good to me my lord pod the trial in a fortnight they'll want an answer before that i already gave them an answer my lord i will not have you dying on my behalf do you hear me if i have to take that long walk to the executioner block i don't want to see your head already mounted my lord pod i am giving you an order go and find my brother tell him i need him and get yourself out of king landing before it too late but they're all a tray of cakes next to death pod this is farewell farewell my lord pod there has never lived a more loyal squire mother says it time to eat what she got boiling wait let me guess potatoes no one boils a potato better than your mom she got they brought me your grandfather body when he died the wildlings guymon hide hide run you know how to get to castle black yes those your parents open your eyes i'm going to eat them do you hear me i'm going to eat your dead mama made me look at it and your dead papa go tell the crows at castle black we need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind aye aye three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the wall seems like that would be a good lesson aye if we go after them we'll be giving them what they want they want to draw us out pick us off a few at a time we have just over 100 man and that including stewards and builders what was it like and me we can't afford to lose a single man we must remember our first responsibility we are the watchers on the wall there got to be a way to protect them you're a champion of the common people lord snow what do you say to brother pyp proposition mance rayder is coming if the wildlings breach the wall they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1 000 miles before they reach an army that can stop them they took me to the great hall there he was we need to shore up castle black and defend the wall that is our job rangers returning help him thought you'd have blue eyes by now what took you so long we were held up by what chains we were guests of the mutineers at craster keep the man i'd married and suffered to father my children and the mutineers stayed they're not going anywhere they've got craster food and his wives poor girls never thought they'd miss their daddy karl running things now he the one who put a knife through craster mouth we need to ride north and kill them all we just went over this boy justice can wait it not about justice i told the wildlings we had over 1 000 man at castle black alone karl and the others know the truth as well as we do a great doughy lump i'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings how long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off mance has all he needs to crush us he just doesn't know it yet as soon as he gets his hands on them he will then he'll throw his full strength at us and even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings there still not a thing we can do to stop them i don't think i can kill 100 wildlings are they attacking a single rider there he was a champion of meereen they want you to send your own champion against him what is he doing i believe he means to he says that we're an army of man without man parts he claims you are no woman at all but a man who hides his cock in his own arsehole ignore him your grace these are meaningless words they're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take

not gamble with your life i was the last to join your army i'm not your general or a member of your queensguard or the commander of your unsullied my mother was a whore i come from nothing i will return to nothing let me kill this man for you very well and was stabbed through the heart you have quite an audience make it worth their while he is very brave your grace yes win or lose as long as the whole city is watching you sure you don't want a horse why would i want a horse horses are faster than man horses are dumber than man i am daenerys stormborn another was happiest torturing animals your masters may have told you lies about me or they may have told you nothing it does not matter i have nothing to say to them i speak only to you first i went to astapor those who were slaves in astapor now stand behind me free next i went to yunkai and was poisoned at our wedding feast those who were slaves in yunkai now stand behind me free now i have come to meereen i am not your enemy your enemy is beside you your enemy steals and murders your children your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands i did not bring you commands i must be cursed nonsense i bring you a choice and i bring your enemies what they deserve forward fire your circumstances have improved markedly you may not have enjoyed watching him die but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him i can promise you that where are we going somewhere safe but i would have been the queen our alliance with the lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us you did wonderful work on joffrey the next one should be easier your brother is dead do you know what that means i'm not trying to trick you it means i'll become king yes you will become king up you go my lady what kind of king do you think you'll be a good king mmm i think so as well you've got the right temperamant for it but what makes a good king hmm what is a good king single most important quality this is hardly the place or the time holiness hmm baelor the blessed was holy and pious 0 game of thrones s04e04 oathkeeper srt "my name when did they take me he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him you gonna fight for him now to tell you the truth this isn't so bad four walls a pot to piss in i was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months is that supposed to make me feel better maybe a bit i'm sorry i didn't come sooner it complicated i was five years old so how is our sister how do you think her son died in her arms her son don't you know what coming hmm my trial for regicide i know the whole bloody country thinks i'm guilty that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than i can count you remember your home and that judge is my father as for cersei well she probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed she did ask so should i turn around and close my eyes depends did you do it the kingslayer brothers you like it i like it i remember when they rowed us away from shore you're really asking if i killed your son are you really asking if i'd kill my brother how can i help you you could set me free you know i can't then there really nothing else to say what do you want me to do kill the guards sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart i'm the lord commander of the kingsguard sorry i'd forgotten how white the beaches were i'd hate for you to do something inappropriate inappropriate you're accused of killing the king freeing you is treason except i didn't do it which is why we're having a trial oh a trial if the killer threw himself before the iron throne confessed to his crimes and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt it wouldn't matter to cersei how tall the trees she won't rest until my head on a spike not just yours she offering a knighthood to whomever finds sansa stark sansa couldn't have done this she had more reason than anyone in the seven kingdoms do you think it a coincidence she disappeared the same night joffrey died no but sansa not a killer not yet anyway and i remember my village burning where are you taking me i'm getting married to your aunt lysa she waiting for us at the eyrie you'll be safe there did you kill joffrey did i kill joffrey i've been in the vale for weeks i know it was you and who helped me with this conspiracy there was ser dontos smoke rising into the sky you used him to get me out of king landing but you would never trust him to kill the king why not because you're too smart to trust a drunk then perhaps it was your husband no how do you know i just do you're right he wasn't involved in joffrey death but you were do you remember your home do you remember that lovely necklace dontos gave you i don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast the poison i don't understand the lannisters gave you wealth power joffrey made you the lord of harrenhal a man with no motive is a man no one suspects always keep your foes confused if they don't know who you are or what you want they can't know what you plan to do next unsullied i don't believe you if they catch you they'll put your head on a spike just like my father you'd risk that just to confuse them so many man they risk so little they spend their lives avoiding danger and then they die i'd risk everything to get what i want and what do you want everything "is grey worm always unsullied my friendship with the lannisters was productive but joffrey a vicious boy with a crown on his head is not a reliable ally and who could trust a friend like that who could trust you i don't want friends like me my new friends are predictable very reasonable people as for what happened to joffrey that was something my new friends wanted very badly before unsullied nothing nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong i can't believe you're going leaving me alone here with these people the time has come my dear there nothing more tedious than a trial except perhaps these gardens if i have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens i'll fling myself from the cliffs have you been to see tomman yet that not true no have they even agreed to the match no one tells me anything i wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather luthor he was engaged to my sister your greataunt viola i was to be given to some targaryen or other marrying a targaryen was all the rage back then but the momant i saw my intended with his twitchy little ferret face and ludicrous silver hair i knew he wouldn't do so the evening before luthor was to propose to my sister perhaps one day you will return to the summer isles i got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber how absentminded of me mmmhmm the following morning luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk and once he could the only thing he wanted was what i'd given him the night before i was good i was very good i don't want return you are even better but you need to act quickly cersei may be vicious but she not stupid she'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can and by the time you're married it'll be too late luckily for you the queen regent is rather distracted at the momant mourning her dear departed boy accusing her brother of his murder which he didn't commit he could have done "kill the masters " but he didn't you don't know grandmother but i do know you don't think i'd let you marry that beast do you what i don't understand shh don't you worry yourself about all that you just do what needs to be done bring it through and again kill the masters very nice good a lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand first thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds let see what you can do oily you just watch for now i can fight have you ever held a sword before i was the best archer in our hamlet i was how are the lessons coming i believe you we'll go hunting for rabbits one day right now watch and learn you two take it slow try and disarm each other you know how to fight you could have gone easier on him he wouldn't have learned anything that way lord snow what do you think you're doing missandel: very well your grace grenn and i were helping them grenn a ranger you're a steward maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch but i didn't someone has to train them and that someone isn't you go find a chamber pot to empty go on do it you traitor bastard give me an excuse missandei is teacher good my queen mormont not here to protect you now get back to work now i said now the bastard wellliked you're not you think i care if they like me we're at war for now but you can't be acting commander forever there will be a choosing the old maester will insist on it "i come from you'll have to continue later you might reconsider his request to march on craster let the mutineers take care of snow or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life a bastard eh took you for highborn my father was highborn my mother wasn't name locke jon snow you fight well it time what brought you up here a sense of duty i wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm i was a game warden in the stormlands fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids i was stupid enough to get caught chose the wall over losing my hand figured i wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here come on get on with it what are you waiting for summer you heard her guess i was wrong you sent for me your grace your grace how formal of you how many kingsguards are posted outside tomman door ser boros is on duty tonight tomorrow i believe so one you have one man guarding the future king i promise you tomman safe we're protecting him she said she came to free us the way you protected joffrey why did catelyn stark set you free what i've been wondering for months ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital why did she set you free you know why she'd hoped i'd send her daughters back to her she hoped or did you promise i swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive i'd return them to her you're a fool so you made a sacred vow to the enemy i wanted to get back to you should i have told her to fuck off you didn't mean it then you have no loyalty to catelyn stark catelyn stark dead so if i told you to leave the capital right now and find sansa if i told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head would you do it the masters are too strong i know you went to see tyrion that creature who murdered our son i had to see him i had to know for myself and he didn't do it cersei you've always pitied him our poor little brother abused by the world despised by his father and sister he'd kill us all if he could she will protect us i want four man at tomman door day and night that will be all lord commander ser pounce how did you get past the kingsguard kingsguard i don't think you're supposed to be here mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night i'm not a visitor your grace word has it i'm to be your bride did you know that people in arranged marriages she defeated the masters' champion often never meet until their wedding day before we decide to spend our lives together we ought to get to know one another don't you think yes but if my mother found out it can be our secret hmm if we're going to be man and wife we'll have a few secrets from her i hope she has a great army so your grace yes tell me a secret hello aren't you a proper fellow that ser pounce very handsome joffrey didn't like him he threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so i wouldn't know i was eating him you want to live the rest of your days in chains that very cruel you don't strike me as cruel no i don't think i am that a relief because you know what happens when we marry we say our vows in front of the high septon and after the ceremony there a feast when we marry i become yours forever "the summer ills " i want to live it getting late i should go may i come and visit you again all right then remember our little secret "ser jaime lannister "knighted and named to the kingsguard in his 16th year "at the sack of king landing murdered his king aerys ii "pardoned by robert baratheon you saw what they did to those children "thereafter known as the kingslayer " it the duty of the lord commander to fill those pages and there still room left on mine valyrian steel mmm it yours i can't accept this it was reforged from ned stark sword you'll use it to defend ned stark daughter you swore an oath what do you think they'll do to us to return the stark girls to their mother lady stark dead arya probably dead too but there still a chance to find sansa and get her somewhere safe i've got something else for you i hope i got your measuremants right i'll find her for lady catelyn and for you i almost forgot i've been through two slave revolts boy i have one more gift i don't need a squire of course you do he'll slow me down my brother owes him a debt he not safe here you'll be keeping him from harm it chivalry i won't slow you down ser my lady i promise i'll serve you well see he a good lad you'll get along they always end the same way: complimants of lord tyrion his axe from the blackwater what are you waiting for a kiss ready the lady horse they say the best swords have names any ideas oathkeeper goodbye brienne come on move i should never have taken her away she wasn't safe here the masters in power and the slaves dead she not safe out there i should have known you told us there were wildlings south of the wall if they're raiding the smaller villages mole town could be next castle black could be next i should go back for gilly we have orders no one to leave the castle i remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help robb and i remember who came after me and brought me home i know how hard it is sam believe me all man must die when you told me about bran going beyond the wall all i could think about was getting my strength back so i could go and find him i wish i could have convinced him to come back with me i tried really i did how fast could they travel a crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton i don't know they'd pass wildling villages they could try and find shelter at one of them but i promise you the wildlings have joined up with mance every village or sheltered place will be deserted except craster you think bran might have found snow i don't mean to interrupt thorne wants to see you your foray to craster keep i'll sanction it but i won't order anyone to go with you a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains volunteers only thank you ser alliser brothers i'm going beyond the wall to craster keep to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them i'm asking for volunteers to come with me there 60 miles of wilderness between here and craster and mance rayder has an army bearing down on us but we have to do this who are you our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before mance does they know the wall they know our defences if mance learns what they know we're lost but if that not enough then consider this if the night watch are truly brothers then lord commander mormont was our father he lived and died for the watch and he was betrayed by his own man missandel: "isles " this one is called grey worm stabbed in the back by cowards he deserved far better all we can give him now is justice who will join me i can't let a recruit come north of the wall then let me say my vows if it a fight you're heading for then you need man who know how thank you brothers no don't i was taken as a baby by the masters of astapor don't please please don't ow you're hurting me karl tanner from gin alley drinking wine from the skull of jeor

hand you're a rare talent when you're fighting cripples anyway i am from an island called naath you learned to fight like a good little boy i'll bet that thrust through the mad king back was pretty as a picture you want to fight pretty or you want to win you talk to my brother this way all the time he got used to it do you think he did it no oh he hated the little twat sure but who didn't when they took you and poison not his style or murder you want to know for sure why don't you ask him you haven't been to see him yet eh we're done for today your brother ever tell you how i came into his service you stood for him in his trial by combat at the eyrie aye but only when lady arryn demanded the trial take place that day you were his first choice 0 game of thrones s04e05 first of his name srt may the warrior grant him courage i now proclaim tomman of the house baratheon it appears my liberation of slaver bay isn't going quite as planned you could sail for westeros and leave it all behind a boy sits on the iron throne a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it they've never been more vulnerable you counselled me against rashness once in qarth i didn't listen that all worked out well how can i rule seven kingdoms if i can't control slaver bay first of his name why should anyone trust me follow me you're a targaryen the mother of dragons i need to be more than that i will not let those i have freed slide back into chains i will not sail for westeros what then i will do what queens do i will rule king of the andals and the first man pull up your hood a memorable shade but how would they know you know what kind of stories poor man enjoy the most ones about rich girls they'll never meet is this the only way into the eyrie the mountains are impassable if you want to get to the eyrie you need to go through the bloody gate it doesn't matter how large your army is if you attack this gate you do it on this road and lord of the seven kingdoms three man abreast and get slaughtered like goats the first lords of the vale didn't have much but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them and the fortress they built here has never been overcome not once in 1 000 years know your strengths use them wisely and one man can be worth 10 000 who would pass the bloody gate lord petyr baelish and his niece alayne long may he reign stand to stand to welcome back lord baelish uncle petyr my lord oh i have brought you a gift lord baelish my lady look what uncle petyr brought me a beautiful gift for a beautiful boy long may he reign it a pleasure to make your acquaintance lady arryn my name is oh do take down that hood child don't you think i know who you are you think i'd let my intended leave the eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was i let him go so he could bring you here to me my flesh and blood it wonderful to meet you aunt lysa you mustn't call me that in front of anyone else i understand no one can know you're here special day it would put us in a very precarious position i would never say a thing the lannisters want to destroy us they've been trying for years now they know what it feels like mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother head they did and my father they killed my father too with poison i wanted to make the little lannister baby man fly but mother said i couldn't your grace make him fly through the moon door and on top of everything else they made you marry that filthy troll they made us both lord tyrion didn't want to i don't believe that did he force himself on you no we never good robin this is your cousin sansa but you're not to call her sansa in front of anyone your grace but uncle petyr and myself do you understand sansa this is my son robin it a pleasure to meet you robin robin show sansa to her chamber take the back stairs go we'll speak soon what took you so long arranging for the ascension of king tomman i extricating sansa getting her here alive she here we've spent more than enough time on her for one evening let get married tonight your grace ought we not inform the lords of the vale about the ceremony there only one lord of the vale the others can all hang lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the momant my husband died trying to get their claws in me i do think that we could wait until i'm done waiting petyr we had our wedding night many years ago or don't you remember like it was yesterday and protect him in these perilous times your grace what wife would do for you the things i've done what wife would trust you the way i've trusted you when you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into jon wine my husband wine when you told me to write a letter to cat telling her it was the the deed is done faded into nothing only speaking of it can make it real there he is tonight it is then let me bathe and dress for the occasion once i'm presentable i'll call on the septon immediately i'm warning you i'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me so loud they'll hear me clear across the narrow sea when will the wedding take place in your mind cersel: as soon as decency permits after we've allowed tomman the appropriate time to mourn his brother and margaery to mourn her husband long may he reign a fortnight that seems reasonable no jugglers no jousting dwarves no 77course meals and your wedding to loras shortly after tomman shortly a fortnight i know you don't like them i didn't like your husband used to pat me on the back a lot i didn't trust him long may he reign we had that in common you don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust then whom can we trust ourselves alone the tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side robert wasn't particularly rich robert had me funding him wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth he sits the throne like he was born to it i suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one do you know how much gold was mined in the westerlands this past year haven't a clue your best guess pounds tons ounces doesn't matter the answer is the same can't be our last working mine ran dry three years ago then how do we pay for anything the crown owes the iron bank of braavos a tremandous amount of money yes he wasn't though was he how much a tremandous amount there must be someone at the iron bank you can speak to come to some arrangemant the iron bank is the iron bank there is no someone someone does work there it is comprised of people and a temple is comprised of stones one stone crumbles and another takes its place and the temple holds its form for 1 000 years or more that what the iron bank is a temple we all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it no he wasn't you can't run from them you can't cheat them you can't sway them with excuses if you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself you pay it back vesting the tyrells in the crown will help a great deal it for the good of the family i understand that i'm not sure my brothers do i know you're building a strong case against tyrion and as a mother that is your right but as a judge i cannot discuss the trial with you you still mourn for joffrey i respect that we don't need to discuss it the lannister legacy is the only thing that matters you've started wars to protect this family turned your back on jaime for refusing to contribute to its future what does tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire joffrey cersei walder frey he was my husband my king meryn trant tywin lannister the red woman beric dondarrion thoros of myr ilyn payne the mountain would you shut up i can't sleep until i say the names the names of every fucking person in westeros he would have been your nightmare only the ones i'm going to kill hate as good a thing as any to keep a person going better than most we come across my brother maybe we can both cross a name off our list if he were here right now what would you do i'd tell him to shut the fuck up so i can get some sleep go on get it over with your list of doomed man i'm almost done only one name left may the smith grant him strength your grace i feel go on the hound thank you your mother always had a sweet tooth really oh yes at suppertime she would go straight for honey cakes candied almonds custard anything sweet eventually your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals cat was the firstborn daughter after all you knew exactly what he was it was important that she remain desirable so father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat my mother fat she never let me have my pudding until i'd finished all my proper food this is before she married your father and moved to the north by the time you were born your father austerity had become hers marriage changes people i didn't mean for you to stop enjoy them how do you like them i did too they're delicious where did you get the lemons you can't grow them up here oh gods no petyr had three crates brought all the way from king landing he knew you liked lemon cakes he so kind he really cares for you think where you'd be without him in their clutches on trial for murder yes i'm very lucky you never love anything in the world the way you love your first child he feels responsible for you oh i know he does i'm so grateful why why does he feel responsible for you well i'm half tully he loved your family so much loved your mother no that what you wanted to say he loves you aunt lysa he married to you your mother never loved him cat always went straight for the sweetest thing the most obvious thing your uncle brandon your handsome arrogant cruel uncle brandon doesn't matter what they do he almost killed petyr in a duel and your mother loved him anyway and now petyr is risking his life to save you the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels has he told you

man i am sorry for his hardship i cannot bring back his goats but i will see he is paid their value three times over send the next one in the noble hizdahr zo loraq begs an audience with the queen whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king the noble hizdahr zo loraq can speak to me himself queen daenerys tales of your beauty were not exaggerated i thank you mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in meereen then it is my honour to receive you my father one of meereen most respected and beloved citizens oversaw the restoration and maintece of its greatest landmarks this pyramid included cost the seven kingdoms dearly for that he has my gratitude i should be honoured to meet him you have your grace you crucified him i pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly your father crucified innocent children my father spoke out against crucifying those children he decried it as a criminal act but was overruled is it justice to answer one crime with another i am sorry you no longer have a father but my treatmant of the masters was no crime in blood and gold you'd be wise to remember that what done is done you are the queen and i am a servant of meereen a servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated and what traditions do you speak of of funeral rite proper burial in the temple of the graces my father and 162 noble meereenese are still nailed to those posts carrion for vultures rotting in the sun your grace i ask that you order these man taken down so that they might receive proper burials gold you loaned him

these meetings aren't always going to be this early are they i was up late last night so does this mean i am a master of something now coins ships lord tywin and i already determined that i shall be the master of ships long before you more than any man living lord tywin it a great honour to have been granted a seat on this council i the trial begins this afternoon we only have the morning for affairs of state so shall we begin sandor clegane has been spotted in the riverlands my lord a coward and a traitor my birds tell me the hound slaughtered five of our soldiers i believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered disgraceful what would it take to make the common soldier across the narrow sea your books are filled with words like "usurper" stupid enough to try his luck with the hound ten silver stags seems a generous bounty make it 100 what else more whispers from the east my lord the targaryen girl daenerys has taken up residence in meereen she has conquered the city and rules as its queen conquered with what she commands an army of unsullied my queen some 8 000 strong and "madman" and "blood right " she has a company of sellswords the second sons she has two knights advising her jorah mormont and barristan selmy and she has three dragons baby dragons larger every year your grace mormont is spying on her for us no longer he appears to be fully devoted to her as for ser barristan it would seem he took his dismissal from the kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated easterners have a different sense of time here our books are filled with numbers he an old man he wasn't fit to protect my son joffrey didn't die on his watch dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world a child with two seasoned warriors counselling her and a powerful army at her back your grace lord varys is right i have been to essos and seen the unsullied firsthand they are very impressive on the battlefield we prefer the stories they tell less so in the bedroom dragons haven't won a war in 300 years armies win them all the time she must be dealt with how my lord by force eventually if it comes to that can your little birds find their way into meereen most certainly my lord hand mmm lord tyrell be a good man fetch my quill and paper prince oberyn more plain lord varys only varys i'm not actually a nobleman no one is under obligation to call me lord and yet everyone does you seem quite knowledgeable about the unsullied did you spend much time in essos five years may i ask why 'tis a big and beautiful world most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born less open to interpretation and never get to see any of it i don't want to be most of us most of us aren't princes you are from essos where lys i have an ear for accents i've lost my accent entirely i have an ear for that as well hmm how did you get here how many fighting man remain loyal to you it a long story one you don't like telling people people i trust my paramour ellaria she would find you very interesting you should come to the brothel and meet her we brought our own wine not the swill they serve here we have some lovely boys on retainer but you did like boys before really girls hmm 4 000 i hope you won't be offended when i say i never would have guessed not at all but i was never interested in girls either what then nothing everybody is interested in something not me when i see what desire does to people what it done to this country i am very glad to have no part in it besides the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things and how many ships do you have such as let me guess i've been pardoned really father orders well we mustn't disappoint father kingslayer i tomman of the house baratheon first of my name king of the andals and the first man and lord of the seven kingdoms uh the ones still afloat ser davos do hereby recuse myself from this trial tywin of the house lannister hand of the king protector of the realm will sit as judge in my stead and with him prince oberyn of the house martell and lord mace of the house tyrell and if found guilty may the gods punish the accused tyrion of the house lannister you stand accused by the queen regent of regicide did you kill king joffrey not at the bottom of blackwater bay no did your wife the lady sansa not that i know of how would you say he died then choked on his pigeon pie so you would blame the bakers or the pigeons just leave me out of it the crown may call its first witness once we'd got king joffrey safely away from the mob the imp rounded on him thirtytwo and how much wheat and barley he slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool it wasn't the first time the imp threatened joffrey right here in this throne room he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit compared his grace to the mad king and suggested he'd meet the same fate and when i spoke in the king defence he threatened to have me killed oh why don't you tell them what joffrey was doing silence pointing a loaded crossbow at sansa stark once i was waiting for salladhor saan here in braavos and beef and pork do you produce on dragonstone while you tore at her clothes and beat her silence you will not speak unless called upon you're dismissed ser meryn "basilisk venom "widow blood "wolfsbane "essence of nightshade "sweetsleep "tears of lys to feed your 4 000 man on your 32 ships "demon dance " " blindeye " i think you have made your point grand maester you have a lot of poison in your store had prince oberyn my stores were plundered by whom by the accused tyrion lannister after he had me wrongfully imprisoned grand maester you examined king joffrey corpse none was it without question poison that killed him without question this was found on the body of dontos hollard the king fool he was last seen spiriting sansa stark the wife of the accused away from the feast she wore this necklace the day of the wedding residue of the most rare and terrible poison was found inside was this one of the poisons stolen from your store it was the strangler you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending a poison few in the seven kingdoms possess and used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth cersel: "i will hurt you for this "a day will come when you think you are safe and happy "and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth "and you will know the debt is paid " your own brother said this to you shortly before the battle of blackwater bay i confronted him about his plans to put joffrey on the front lines from our perspective as it turned out when the attack came joff insisted on remaining at the battlemants he believed his presence would inspire the troops tyrion said "and you will know the debt is paid " what debt i discovered he'd been keeping whores in the tower of the hand i asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behaviour belongs he wasn't pleased thank you your grace for the courage of your testimony i'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request do you remember the precise nature of this threat i'm afraid i do my lord he said "perhaps you should speak more softly to me then "monsters are dangerous "and just now kings are dying like flies " and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council yes after we received word of robb stark death he didn't seem gladdened by the news perhaps his marriage to sansa stark but we thank you for paying us the honour of your visit had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause you're excused lord varys father may i ask the witness one question one you once said that without me this city would have faced certain defeat you said the histories would never mantion me but you would not forget have you forgotten lord varys sadly my lord my lord i'm not a lord ser davos seaworth i never forget a thing we will adjourn for now toll the bells in an hour time clear the court you'd condemn your own son to death i've condemned no one the trial is not over this isn't a trial it a farce cersei has manipulated everything and you know it i know nothing of the sort you've always hated tyrion he killed his king you would not be either here as did i do you know the last order the mad king gave me to bring him your head i saved your life so you could murder my brother it won't be murder it'll be justice justice i'm performing my sworn duty as hand of the king if tyrion is found guilty he will be punished accordingly he'll be executed no he'll be punished accordingly once you said "family is what lives on "all that lives on " in braavos you told me about a dynasty that would last 1 000 years what happens to your dynasty when tyrion dies i'm a kingsguard forbidden by oath to carry on the family line i'm well aware what happens to your name who carries the lion banner into future battles your nephews lancel lannister others whose names i don't even remember what happens to my dynasty if i spare the life of my grandson killer together we were going to run three shiploads of the finest thieves are not rewarded with titles it survives through me i'll leave the kingsguard i'll take my place as your son and heir if you let tyrion live done when the testimony concluded and a guilty verdict rendered tyrion will be given the chance to speak he'll plead for mercy i'll allow him to join the night watch in three days' time he'll depart for castle black and live out his days at the wall i didn't do the thieving you'll remove your white cloak immediately you will leave king landing to assume your rightful place at casterly rock you will marry a suitable woman and father children named lannister and you'll never turn your back on your family again you have my word and you have mine not going well is it you're going to be found guilty that would be the pirates oh you think so and when you are you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the wall father agreed to it he'll spare your life and allow you to join the night watch ned stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out father is not joffrey he'll keep his word how do you know do you trust me keep your mouth shut no more outbursts this will all be over soon i just moved what they stole from one place to another the crown may call its next witness state your name shae do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest i swear it do you know this man yes tyrion lannister how do you know him i was handmaiden to his wife lady sansa this man stands accused of murdering king joffrey this is the paymant that was demanded by king stannis for my crimes what do you know of this i know that he guilty he and sansa planned it together silence continue she wanted revenge for her father her mother her brother she blamed their deaths on the king tyrion was happy to help he hated joffrey he hated the queen he hated you my lord i consider it an honest accounting he stole poison from the grand maester chamber to put in joffrey wine how could you possibly know all this why would he reveal such plans to his wife maid i wasn't just her maid i was his whore i beg your pardon you said you were his his whore how did you come to be in his service he an honest man and he your best chance he stole me i was with another man a knight in your lordship army but when tyrion arrived at the camp he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent he broke the knight arm and brought me to lord tyrion "you belong to me now " he said "i want you to fuck me like it my last night in this world " silence and did you did i what fuck him like it was his last night in this world to get back the money you've sunk into westeros i did everything he wanted whatever he told me to do to him whatever he felt like doing to me i kissed him where he wanted i licked him where he wanted i let him put himself where he wanted i was his property i would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored he ordered me to call him "my lion " so i did i took his face in my hands and said "i am yours and you are mine " which is a lot wars are expensive shae please don't i am a whore remember that was before he married sansa after that all he wanted was her but she wouldn't let him into her bed so he promised to kill king joffrey for her father i wish to confess the war is over as long as stannis lives the war is not over i wish to confess you wish to confess i saved you i saved this city and all your worthless lives i should have let stannis kill you all tyrion do you wish to confess yes father i'm guilty welcome to the iron bank who the real power in king landing is that what you want to hear you admit you poisoned the king no of that i'm innocent i'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime i am guilty of being a dwarf you are not on trial for being a dwarf oh yes i am i've been on trial for that my entire life have you nothing to say in your defence nothing but this i did not do it ser davos humour me i did not kill joffrey but i wish that i had watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1 000 lying whores i wish i was the monster you think i am i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you i would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it ser meryn escort the prisoner back to his cell i will not give my life for joffrey murder tywin lannister how old is tywin lannister and i know i'll get no justice here so i will let the gods decide my fate i demand a trial by combat sixtyseven and when he dies who in command a halfgrown boy the product of incest cersei lannister a queen whose people despise her jaime lannister a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect please sit when tywin gone who do you back that is a problem for another time i think it a problem for now there only one reliable leader left in westeros stannis he got the birthright he in his prime he a tried and tested battle commander and he doesn't just talk about paying people back he does it the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way what can we do for you lord stannis the captain shouts to his first mate "bring me my red shirt " the first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on and when the pirates try to board the brave captain leads his man to victory a few days later the lookout screams "two pirate ships" the crew is shivering like scared mice but the courageous captain hollers "bring me my red shirt" this is stannis of the house baratheon after the battle the first mate asks "captain why do you call for your red shirt before battle" the captain replies "so that if i am stabbed you will not see me bleed " the next morning the lookout screams "ten pirate ships we are surrounded" the crew goes silent they all look to their brave captain waiting for his usual command calm as ever the captain bellows 0 game of thrones s04e07 mockingbird srt i made a deal for you you fell in love with a whore could i have a drink dying is thirsty work wish it were wine

looked into the flames this morning the lord spoke to me yes brilliant speech he said "tonight you will have your last good bath in a long while "make it count " a joke not a very good one i'm afraid it was i humour isn't my strength that because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth if they're lies my lady aren't they best avoided not always i'm sorry what am i grateful for they'll be talking about it for days to come most of these powders and potions are lies deceptions to make man think they witnessed our lord power once they step into his light they will see the lie for what it was a trick that led them to the truth a pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky and this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear and a drop of this in any man wine will drive him wild with lust i thought you were a realist did you use it with stannis no don't be upset man never crave what they already have it only flesh it needs what it needs no act done in service of the lord can ever be called a sin i thank god every day for bringing you to us and stannis to you he wants to bring shireen with us didn't realise you'd die for pride i think that would be illadvised my daughter has heretical tendencies as you're well aware i don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me but whichever the case she should stay home i understand how you feel but that is impossible why you don't need powders and potions my queen you don't need lies you are strong enough to look into the lord light and see his truth for yourself don't give up on me just yet however harsh it is however hard for us to understand you don't need my help but i will need yours soon when we set sail your daughter must be with us the lord needs her jorah the andal are you here to see our queen she in a good mood khaleesi you're here early later than some i survived one trial by combat even though you weren't there to save me you don't approve it not a question of approval it a question of trust you neither approve nor trust why would i the man a sellsword didn't you fight for the golden company before pledging your sword to my brother i did i trust you daario naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands how could you ever have faith in a man like that i can't save you this time either i could never have faith in a man like daario that why i've sent him and the second sons to retake yunkai you have i have without you there to rule khaleesi i fear the masters will simply bide their time wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control that is why i've ordered daario to execute every master in yunkai the masters tear babies from their mothers' arms they mutilate little boys by the thousands they train little girls in the art of pleasuring old man my training has proved that i can't beat a stable boy with my left hand they treat man like beasts as you said yourself herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating man like beasts the slaves you freed brutality is all they've ever known if you want them to know something else you'll have to show it to them and repay the slavers with what kindness a fine a stern warning it tempting to see your enemies as evil all of them but there good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought let the priests argue over good and evil where your sense of adventure slavery is real i can end it i will end it and those behind it i sold man into slavery khaleesi and now you are helping me show them to freedom i wouldn't be here to help you if ned stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of yunkai the man who came to me the other day about burying his father hizdahr zo loraq he will accompany the second sons and serve as my ambassador to yunkai even if you lose imagine the look on father face when you fall he will tell the masters what has happened in meereen he will explain the choice they have before them they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one well go and catch daario before he leaves tell him i changed my mind yes khaleesi no tell him you changed my mind rat cunts fucking whore our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword you're doing it wrong you need to burn away that horrible bit there otherwise it gonna get infected and fester i know you don't like fire but if you don't do it right no fire it'll only take a second it won't hurt that much no fire shut up about it about everything thanks to you i'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the lannisters hold sway the opportunity to live and die at the wall as punishmant for a crime i did not commit it is tempting which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going i'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten no reward is worth this much trouble wish i'd never laid eyes on you you say your brother gave you that sword my brother gave me this it was just like you said a while back pressed me to the fire like i was a nice juicy mutton chop why well thought i stole one of his toys i didn't steal it i was just playing with it the pain was bad the smell was worse but the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it my father who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire you think you're on your own let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least bit of comfort never hurt anyone bronn fought for me once he'll do it again we've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks i think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you couldn't agree more my lady just don't start expecting silk underclothes not working for your former lord any longer yes my lady don't get drunk no my lady can i get you anything else no this will do nicely thank you if he wins kidney pie is wonderful thanks i do my best a good kidney pie is all about the ingredients flour lard water eggs milk easy enough but the meat peacetime or not getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy i mean some people settle for plain old beef kidneys got no right to cook anything them oh and the gravy i expect i'll be in his debt for the rest of my life don't get me started on the gravy very difficult to get right see a lot of people give up on the gravy you cannot give up no gravy no pie simple as that that nice armour are you a knight no oh it just people with armour are usually knights generally speaking from king landing though aren't you if he wins from there myself originally flea bottom born and bred what brings you to these parts we're looking for someone someone in particular maybe they came in here a lot of people come in here just the other day we had 17 a girl tall red hair very pretty her name is sansa stark but she may be using a different name starks what like them lot from "winterhell" no ain't seen anyone like that will you find him for me i heard they was all traitors don't need no traitors in here i pledged my life to their mother catelyn stark i swore to her i'd bring her daughters home sure i can't get you a bit more kidney pie what it nothing my lady you wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing don't want to offend my lady truly i don't you're not interesting enough to be offensive the lannisters want lady sansa who does cersei plan on naming as a champion the lannisters have money people kill for money i don't think we should be telling people we're searching for lady sansa my lady my lord could i have a word what about not kidney pie you seem like a proper lady someone who could be trusted i never met no sansa stark but i know her sister arya no one seen arya stark since her father was beheaded i hope it ser meryn trant she presumed dead she weren't when i last spoke to her when was that heading up north with the night watch she was all dressed up as a boy like your ladyship only without the armour going by the name arry so what happened to her well the quick version the lannisters took us prisoner we escaped i'd enjoy watching bronn disembowel that pompous child beater the brotherhood took us prisoner they sold me to the innkeep they were gonna sell arya to her mother at riverrun along with another prisoner big ugly fellow foul mouth and a face like a halfburnt ham not friendly the hound that the one if you find her could you give her this she liked the last one i gave her but well this one turned out better um you were saying her mother dead grandfather dead you threw your life away no walder frey is the new lord of riverrun the brotherhood isn't going to riverrun they'll take her to the eyrie my lady why the eyrie her aunt lysa arryn catelyn stark sister she arya last living relative with money she hates the lannisters lord tyrion made sure i knew which house married which and who hated who not ser meryn sansa could be there too could be you sure about this no i imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour i did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day mmm do tell i've got every kind of filth down here except the kind i like your sister oh go on move it cersei approached me we spoke a great deal about her daughter how worried your sister is about her she was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you i think she may have even believed it herself making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts it was difficult for her to hide her true intentions it is rare to meet a lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead lannisters she desperately wants to see you killed and you she didn't need to bother you it looks as though i've taken care of that myself the joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck she wanted this for a long time yes i know we met you and i many years ago i think i would have remembered that unlikely you had just been born our father brought me and my sister elia with him on a visit to casterly rock come on my first time away from dorne i didn't like anything about the rock not the food not the weather not your accents nothing but the biggest disappointmant you you and my family have more in common than you might admit the whole way from dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to tywin lannister a head twice the size of his body mercy a tail between his legs claws one red eye the privates of both a girl and a boy that would have made things so much easier when we met your sister she promised she would show you to us every day we would ask every day she would say "soon " then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak your head was a bit large your arms and legs were a bit small please but no claw no red eye no tail between your legs just a tiny pink cock we didn't try to hide our disappointmant "that not a monster " i told cersei "that just a baby " and she said "he killed my mother " and she pinched your little cock so hard i thought she might pull it off until your brother made her stop "it doesn't matter " she told us "everyone says he will die soon please mercy "i hope they are right "he should not have lived this long " well sooner or later cersei always gets what she wants and what about what i want justice for my sister and her children if you want justice you've come to the wrong place i disagree cersel: ser gregor i've come to the perfect place i want to bring those who have wronged me to justice and all those who have wronged me are right here i will begin with ser gregor clegane who killed my sister children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her too i will be your champion hello robin what are you doing welcome to the capital i'm building my home winterfell at least i think i am i haven't been back there in a very long time why did you leave it a long story i stay here in the eyrie mother says it dangerous on the roads and i have to keep myself safe because i'm the lord of the vale and a very important person yes you certainly are when will you go back it not a joke you understand that don't you thank you for riding here so quickly probably never my family doesn't live there any more and someone burned it down oh does winterfell have a moon door no i'm afraid not it not high up in the mountains it down on the ground that sounds dangerous how do you make people fly we don't what do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like you seem to be in good form i never did anything with them at all girls didn't take part in that where i came from well i'm lord of the vale when i grow up i'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me or you when we get married you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and whoosh right through the moon door i like the sound of that let put a moon door in your winterfell who am i fighting all right it can go in here in this big tower be careful you've ruined it now i'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing i didn't ruin it you did it was already ruined because it didn't have a moon door i was fixing it knocking things down isn't fixing them it ruining them i didn't ruin it you're being stupid i didn't ruin it robin i'm sorry i children does it matter i hit him yes i saw i shouldn't have done that no his mother should have a long time ago consider it a step in the right direction if he tells aunt lysa let me worry about aunt lysa i was trying to remember what everything looked like i'll never see it again a lot can happen between now and never if you want to build a better home could be food first you must demolish the old one why did you really kill joffrey tell me why i loved your mother more than you could ever know given the opportunity what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love in a better world one where love could overcome strength and duty you might have been my child but we don't live in that world could be soldiers you're more beautiful than she ever was lord baelish call me petyr you wanted to see me aunt lysa come here sansa do you know how far the fall is no neither do i precisely hundreds of feet it fascinating you shouldn't be sitting out here like this what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height the impact breaks them right apart like eggs dropped on the floor sometimes pieces remain intact you'll find the head sitting on its own every hair in place blue eyes staring at nothing i know what you did i'm so sorry aunt lysa i never should have hit robin where else to sit i promise it won't happen don't be coy with me you little whore you kissed petyr i didn't you don't understand i saw you you can't lie to me because i saw it with my own eyes he kissed me i pulled away liar whore he is mine my father my husband my sister they all stood between us and now they're all dead that what happens to people who stand between petyr and me look down tried to walk back to me hut look down lysa let her go you want her this emptyheaded child let her go she just like her mother she'll never love you i lied for you i killed for you why did you bring her here i'll send her away i swear on my life i swear to all the gods hurt too much let her go lysa oh my sweet wife my sweet silly wife i have only loved one woman only one my entire life your sister of course it a joke just not a very funny one then i remembered they burned me hut down who were "they" i stopped asking a while ago that not going to get better doesn't seem so a bad way to go haven't you had enough of what i know time to go i couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies take matters into me own hands the thought has occurred to me so why go on habit nothing could be worse than this maybe nothing is worse than this nothing isn't better or worse than anything nothing is just nothing who are you my name is arya i couldn't do it arya stark you her father her captor bringing her to her aunt for ransom a fair exchange that is always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings you give me i give you fair a balance no balance any more 0 game of thrones s04e08 the mountain and the viper srt here we are too bad you got a hangnail for a cock do you remember that i'm sorry i'm sorry they did that to you why why sorry it a terrible thing to do to a boy if the masters never cut me i never am unsullied i never stand in the plaza of pride when daenerys stormborn orders us to kill the masters i never am chosen to lead the unsullied first time i saw you with your breeches down i thought you were a eunuch i never meet missandei from the island of naath i am sorry i for today i am sorry grey worm i'm glad you saw me so am i kraken mmm strong as long as they're in the sea when you take them

crying this morning commander of this garrison and you say you're theon greyjoy yes and why should i believe that i was born on pyke to balon greyjoy his third and last living son i am your prince i swear it by the drowned god what is dead may never die what is dead may never die woke me up and if you were my prince why are you marching with a bolton army lord bolton took me captive after winterfell he sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn and what does lord bolton want you are fading from sickness you are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea lord bolton implores you to protect your man and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold do this and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me you hear me yes the boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore he wants us to surrender my own father your king surrendered years ago to robert baratheon i watched him bend the knee there was no shame there he fought with honour as did you "no shame " "fought with honour " i'm sorry i didn't hear "no shame " "fought with honour " well got anything to say only a whipped dog would speak this way or a woman are you a woman boy you don't know the ironborn will not surrender my name is reek you go tell your master that theon greyjoy or whoever the fuck you are reek what in the hell are you muttering reek i'm sorry

out of fashion flaying sad but true traditions are important where are we without our history eh i don't care if you're sorry yes my lord will we go home now i believe we will to our new home you have foreign blood don't you baelish a greatgrandfather from braavos yes i suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally our forebears settled the vale thousands of years ago we've fought off invaders ever since the beauty of the vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families ready keep that baby quiet or i will lady arryn often told me that you were her rock lord royce she told me nothing about you baelish but i didn't need to hear from her moneylender whoremonger you've been licking tywin lannister boots so long it a wonder your tongue not black my lord and when jon arryn named you master of coin no one cared always been a grubby job why not let a grubby man do it but when i heard you were lurking here fawning over the lady arryn lady arryn invited me don't you ever touch him she and i have been close since childhood yes we all know how close you were lady arryn predilections were her own affair her death is our affair of course her suicide shattered us all she was an odd fish everyone knew that but suicide she adored that boy of hers i don't see her abandoning him not by choice strange that within days of your arrival little wildling bitch you've married lady arryn and she fallen through the moon door she was always prone to melancholy my lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours we were told there was a witness a girl a niece of yours i believe a girl with no learning and scattered wits i assure you she would be of no help we'd like to speak with her let me fetch her no need you should have stayed with your own kind we prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated come closer child you have nothing to fear from us or him lord baelish here is your uncle your name is alayne perhaps you would feel more comfortable if lord baelish left the room my lady i wasn't asking you he can stay speak up girl you're not a damn kitchen mouse tell us what you saw are you listening to me shut your mouth i'm sorry lord baelish i have to tell the truth i'll tell you everything please alayne leave nothing out my name is not alayne it sansa stark eldest daughter of lord eddard stark lord royce we met when you came to winterfell you were escorting your son ser waymar to the wall sansa stark what you tell lies right to my face you little worm lord baelish has told many lies all to protect me since my father was executed i have been a hostage in king landing a plaything for joffrey to torture or queen cersei to tormant they beat me they humiliated me they married me to the imp i had no friends in king landing except one it just an owl you dumb bitch he saved me smuggled me away when he had the chance he knew i'd be safe here in the eyrie with my own blood my aunt lysa but the lannisters have friends everywhere even the vale he made me swear not to tell anyone my true name your secret is safe with us my lady your father grew up right here in these halls we hunted together many times he was a fine man no it not tell us what happened to your aunt sansa you knew her well my lords my lady she was a troubled woman she always loved lord baelish she told me herself from the momant he arrived at the gates of riverrun a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack she confessed to me she never loved lord arryn she did as her father commanded as so many of us have when the gods finally allowed her to be with lord baelish she was so happy for a time shh my aunt was a jealous lady she was terrified that lord baelish didn't love her any more that he would abandon her for a younger woman and then one day she saw him kiss me lady sansa it was a peck on the cheek lord royce nothing more lord baelish is my uncle now by marriage he always been so kind to me i was so happy to be here to be free i should never have left her there all because of him but my aunt turned on me she cursed me called me a whore promised to throw me through the moon door when lord baelish tried to calm her she struck him she said she didn't want to live any more she stood on the edge of that moon door he tried to reason with her promised her she was the only one he had ever loved but she stepped through those doors and she was the rains of castamere you couldn't have known of course i could've it not your fault sweet girl it not your fault you could see it in the way she raised that boy feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old lord royce this is hardly the time apologies my lady and to you as well baelish we treated you a bit harshly you want justice lord royce i can hardly complain about that i want the same not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there they've been raiding the villages close by for lysa no but for her son only 20 years ago the knights of the vale rode behind jon arryn ned stark robert baratheon they fought together to overcome the mad king and since then arryn and royce corbray waynwood all the great houses of the vale watched from the corner a timid boy at a tavern brawl are you questioning our courage i want to know which side you're on do you support the lannisters the house that executed your friend ned stark and we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers of course we don't support the damn lannisters no catelyn stark begged her sister for support and lysa refused by staying out of the fray you've allowed tywin lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point who stands against him now who would you have us back lord baelish robb stark is dead i'd have you back robin arryn lord of the vale robin arryn is a sickly little boy our brothers had orders to stay at castle black and sickly little boys sometimes become powerful man more often they die young i adored lysa with all my heart but she loved her son so much she became overprotective he needs to learn how to swing a sword how to ride a horse aye it time yes time for him to tour the vale to visit all the castles in his domain time for robin to leave the nest ser barristan yes so it all right then who sent you ser barristan ser jorah have i forgotten a council meeting no what this a royal pardon signed by robert baratheon you spied on her who gave you this does it matter have you told her i wanted to tell you first mantoman black jack and kegs and mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules rather than go behind your back let me speak with her in private you'll never be alone with her again why did the usurper pardon you if we could speak alone no speak to me here explain it to me who do you think sent this to meereen who profits this is the work of tywin lannister he wants to divide us i didn't say it was all right i'm saying they shouldn't have been there if we're fighting each other we're not fighting him the pardon was signed the year we met why were you pardoned unless you're saying this documant was forged it is not forged why then i sent letters to varys the spymaster of king landing what was the content of these letters information what information we're pledged to guard the realms of man when you and viserys arrived in pentos his plan to marry you to khal drogo when you were married when your brother died you told him i was carrying drogo child i yes or no khaleesi don't call me that did you tell him i was carrying drogo child yes that wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information she dead because of me i stopped you from drinking his wine because you knew it was poisoned i suspected you betrayed me from the first forgive me i never meant please khaleesi forgive me you sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother throne i have protected you we can't even guard mole town fought for you killed for you and you want me to forgive you i have loved you love love how can you say that to me any other man and i would have you executed but you i do not want you in my city dead or alive go back to your masters in king landing collect your pardon if you can daenerys please don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name you have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city you fucking deaf we can't go after them you know that if you're found in meereen past break of day i'll have your head thrown into slaver bay go now moat cailin is yours father walk with me has there been any word from locke no unimportant a cripple a young boy none of the northern lords have seen them it what they want dead most likely most of the ironborn have fled the north now more will follow thanks to you tell me what you see moors fields hills tell me what you see nothing not nothing the north ride 700 miles that way you're still in the north 400 miles that way and little sam 300 miles that way the north is larger than the other six kingdoms combined and i am the warden of the north the north is mine now tell me what is your name ramsay snow no not ramsay snow open it from this day until your last day you are ramsay bolton as if i cut their throats myself son of roose bolton warden of the north you honour me i swear i will uphold your name and your tradition i will be worthy of you father i promise come reek i'll be needing a bath yes first time i saw you you were just a child a girl from the north come to the capital for the first time you're not a child any longer maybe she managed to hide herself why did you help me they would have thrown you through the moon door if they found you guilty that not an answer if they'd have executed you what would they have done with me i don't know neither do i better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't and you think you know me i know what you want do you i thought it'd make me happy i thought all of you was dead but it doesn't not really nothing makes you happy lots of things make me happy like what killing polliver killing rorge so you're sad because you didn't get to kill joffrey yourself is that it at least i could have been there to watch i wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over aye nothing in the world beats that look you protected him for most of his life you think you could have saved him you went up north with mormont and no one came back i wasn't the damn winetaster little shit deserved to die but poison poison a woman weapon man kill with steel that your stupid pride talking it why you'll never be a great killer i'd have killed joffrey with a chicken bone if i had to i'd pay good money to see that you should have let me burn it it a fleabite that fleabite got you walking a lot slower than you used to not for ages well we won't have to walk too much further you really think my aunt will pay for me aye i've never even met her doesn't matter you're her blood family honour all that horseshit it all you lords and ladies ever talk about i'm not a lady who would pass the bloody gate the bloody hound sandor clegane but then you did and his travelling companion arya stark niece of your lady lysa arryn then i offer my condolences lady arryn died three days ago i've never left home before uncle petyr i'm afraid to leave you shouldn't be the lord of the vale belongs in the eyrie mother said it not safe outside she survived craster and he was the worst shit i've ever met it wasn't safe for her inside people die at their dinner tables they die in their beds they die squatting over their chamber pots everybody dies sooner or later don't worry about your death worry about your life take charge of your life for as long as it lasts that is what it means to be lord of the vale shall we go same wrong guess every fucking time she survived the long march to the wall wine always helps i thank you for it trial by combat deciding a man guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other man hack each other to pieces tells you something about the gods how much longer soon do you think oberyn has a chance she survived a white walker for fuck sake the red viper of dorne you don't get a name like that unless you're deadly right i've never seen him fight oh he going to die i'm going to die oberyn believes in himself that putting it mildly what the punishmant for regicide drawing and quartering hanging breaking at the wheel beheading seems rather ordinary and he was my nephew as well so what is that she might have got out fratricide is brothers and filicide is sons nepoticide that the one matricide patricide infanticide suicide there no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word cousins you're right there is no word for cousinkilling well done do you remember cousin orson orson lannister of course wetnurse dropped him on his head and left him simple she might have simple used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock nothing made him happier nothing made you happier you'd think being tormanted from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted on the contrary laughing at another person misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else the joke wore thin though for you you drifted away i had other interests if they hit mole town yes other interests but i stayed with orson why i was curious why was he smashing all those beetles what did he get out of it first thing i did was ask him "orson why are you smashing all those beetles" he gave me an answer "smash the beetles smash 'em " i wasn't deterred i was the smartest person i knew then we're next certainly i had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron so i went to maester volarik library volarik tried to touch me once turns out far too much has been written about great man and not nearly enough about morons doesn't seem right in any case i found nothing that illuminated the nature of orson affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter so i went back to the source mance and his army must be close i may not have been able to speak with orson but i could observe him watch him the way man watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behaviour and as i watched i became more and more sure of it there was something happening there his face was like the page of a book written in a language i didn't understand but he wasn't mindless he had his reasons 100 000 of them and i became possessed with knowing what they were i began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him i would eat my lunch in the garden chewing my mutton to the music of and when i wasn't watching him i was thinking about him father droned on about the family legacy and i thought about orson beetles i read the histories of targaryen conquests did i hear dragon wings no i heard and there what 105 of us left and i still couldn't figure out why he was doing it and i had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason every day around the world man woman and children are murdered by the score who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles i know but still it filled me with dread piles and piles of them years and years of them how many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt you counting black jack kegs and mully in my dreams i found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see i woke up crying weeping for their shattered little bodies i tried to stop orson once he was twice your

good bit to drink jon come back her fangs were sharp but she knew how to use them and she was nice and soft down below no she was no ordinary beast many is the man who i want you to tell me what it was like to have someone i know you never fucked a bear you know you never fucked a bear right now i don't want to think about the bear you never fucked right now all i want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow heart we could be waiting here a while good the longer we wait the more arrows i'll have they came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs to be with someone then they started hunting us down but this time we're the ones doing the hunting you've got a lot to say about killing even more words than arrows back in those villages i killed just as many of them as you did more i reckon yes but none of those were your crow lover i probably killed him already so you've said and if not to love someone and have them love you back the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around me neck more words know what i think you do when you see him serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge what you've been thinking about that ginger minge wondering what it tastes like maybe i have jon snow is mine anyone else tries to kill him i'll have an arrow for them we're all gonna die a lot sooner than i'd planned and not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me and what is it that couldn't wait until morning tarly maester aemon how did you know that it was you who else but samwell tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night let me help you oh no need i know my way around this library better than any other place in castle black thousands of books and no eyes to read them old age is a wonderful source of ironies you're the closest i'll ever get to knowing if nothing else but you didn't answer my question what are you reading maester faull ah the wildlings i can assure you that the closest maester faull ever got to a wildling was this very library but what he says about what they do it all true 0 game of thrones s04e10 the children srt you're wearing a black cloak again i was loyal you're speaking to the one true king boy you will address him as "your grace " i know he the king my father died for him my name is jon snow your grace i'm ned stark son your father was an honourable man he was your grace what do you think he'd have done with him i was this man prisoner once he could have tortured me he could have killed me to him and to my night watch vows but he spared my life i think my father would have taken him prisoner listened to what he had to say very well then take him your grace if my father had seen the things that i've seen he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall all of them i would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate bloody martells all your vows the cause appears to be manticore venom it is the death head manticore i've read a great deal about it it a horrible poison usually mantari in origin oh there nothing to be done yes there is may i ask what you think you're doing saving him your grace i wish it were otherwise but ser gregor is beyond saving she wasn't enough to turn you eh well well beyond this man is not even a maester let alone grand maester that for the best no maester knows how to save him that is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel your grace his curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural rightly so in my opinion you're dismissed grand maester but your grace this is my laboratory not any more but were you enough to turn her you can save him difficult to say your grace but if my past work is any guide we stand a chance do everything you can come to me for anything you need thank you your grace you should know the process may change him somewhat will it weaken him she put three arrows in me when i escaped oh no very well then not another word we've been over this the matter closed i'm opening it again you were betrothed to loras tyrell you're still betrothed to loras tyrell and you will marry loras tyrell as soon as tomman marries margaery i will not jaime cannot marry or inherit lands did you see her again at castle black tyrion sentence will be carried out tomorrow you have on several occasions made great claims about your commitmant to this family future your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was i don't care i will stay in king landing where i belong with my son the king when you were nine years old i was called to the capital i decided to take your brother with me and not you you insisted that you would not be left at casterly rock under any circumstances lf you recall i'm not interested in hearing yes another one of your smug stories about the time you won this isn't going to be one of those times do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will when you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the battle of blackwater do you remember i was sitting on the iron throne with tomman i was about to give him essence of nightshade that how far i was willing to go when i thought someone awful had come to take my son away and someone awful is coming to take him away no joffrey is dead myrcella been sold like livestock and now you want to ship me off to highgarden and steal my boy my last boy margaery will dig her claws in you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart i will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen and how will you do that i'll tell everyone the truth she dead what truth would that be you don't know do you you never believed it how is that possible what am i saying of course it possible how can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing we were right there in front of you and you didn't see us one real look in the past 20 years at your own children and you would have known i've been sent to negotiate with you your doing known what everything they say is true about jaime and me no your legacy is a lie no no no no i don't believe you yes you do cersel: jaime you won one fewer brother must be proud of yourself there really nothing you wouldn't do is there no for my family no nothing i would do things for my family you couldn't imagine tyrion is your family he not you don't get to choose i do so do you you can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world are you really mad enough to blame him for that he didn't decide to kill her he was an infant a disease doesn't decide to kill you all the same you cut it out before it does what do you decide we'll drink to her what do you choose the things i did to get back to you to endure all that only to find you i choose you those are words yes like the ones i just said to father i told him told him what i told him about us you told him i told him i won't marry loras tyrell i told him i'm staying right here with tomman with you of all the ways i'd kill you poison would be the last you think he'll just accept that go and ask him what did you say i don't want to talk about tywin lannister i don't choose tywin lannister i don't love tywin lannister i love my brother i love my lover people will whisper they'll make their jokes let them they're all so small i can't even see them i only see what matters someone will walk in i don't care ygritte ygritte you stand before daenerys stormborn the unburnt queen of meereen queen of the andals and the rhoynar and the first man khaleesi of the great grass sea breaker of chains and mother of dragons thank you for seeing me your grace my name is fennesz i can speak the common tongue if you wish you speak it very well that not wine before you freed me i belonged to master mighdal i was tutor to his children i taught them languages

fear and squalor i am not alone there are many outside waiting to beg the same of you i did not take this city to preside over the injustice i fought to destroy i took it to bring people freedom but freedom means making your own choices i will allow you to sign a contract with your former master it may not cover a period lasting longer than a year thank you your grace thank you one of our giants
